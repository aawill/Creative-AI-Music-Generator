Ladies and gentlemen, you are now tuned into the best
$Hort Dizzle, Pha Phizzle, $hort Dizzle, J Phizzle, sing
Introducing, for the first time on stage, The Phinzzles
Aw, they sound so beautiful, don't you agree?

Nothin' in the world make a playa feel better
Than when we do it like this
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good

Nothin' in the world make a playa feel better
Than when we're doin' it, oh
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good

I know you like it when I cometo your house
You like it in the car, you like it on the couch
You like to lay me on my back and rub on my chest
You do me up like the best and then you want the rest

You make me feel like I'll never know a better friend
I hope you never stop, I hope it never ends
I must be tastin' somethin' like your favorite flavor
Can you do it again? You said maybe later

Baby, wait a little while, you said your jaws was hurtin'
So I turned out the lights and closed all the curtains
But when you closed your eyes I put it all on your cheek
'Cause I'm wide awake and can't fall asleep, now kiss it

Nothin' in the world make a playa feel better
Than when we do it like this
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good

Nothin' in the world make a playa feel better
Than when we're doin' it, oh
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good

Yeah, I'm one of those rappers, I reap the benefits
I'll dated a Too $hort fan, a cute freaky lil' chick
I used to go to L.A. and have fun with Super Head
When you was just a kid gettin' sent straight to bed

You used to get whoopers when ya bought my beat
But now she's all grown up and she's wantin' me
The way you take it out
I bet you won a gold medal at the Kiss Olympics now

I just spit the pimpin', I like the thick women
I like the slim goodies and the real big women
But I just love the way you do it, it's original
I feel like a pimp, player, mack, daddy, gigolo, damn

Nothin' in the world make a playa feel better
Than when we do it like this
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good

Nothin' in the world make a playa feel better
Than when we're doin' it, oh
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good

Remember Tina? Tina, the cleaner?
I had a good time last time I seen her
Old School Betty and Deepthroat Dana
You're always so ready, I'm c***

Right now, this is just wonderful
I can't tell, it's like you havin' more fun than $hort
It's better than two women at the same time
Or even ten dime-pieces, waitin' in line

Takin' turns, while they s*** on each others spit
Want a playa with some game to bust on her upper lip
Massagin' her tongue, while I tickle her tonsils
It's no doubt though, I get b***, yo

Nothin' in the world make a playa feel better
Than when we do it like this
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good

Nothin' in the world make a playa feel better
Than when we're doin' it, oh
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good''''''''''''''''''
