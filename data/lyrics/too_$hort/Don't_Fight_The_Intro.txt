Whatcha Say hoe...? Yeah you...
Can I ask you a question?
Can you Get In Where You Fit In bitch?

Get mad if you want, I won't front
'Cause I got a new tape and it's full of bumps
So roll you raps over they all out dated
Too $hort, baby, comin' straight X rated
Oakland funk is all on this tape
You heard 7 get ready for 8
That's right, bitch
$Hort said 8 of them
Don't believe me
Start countin' while I name them
Don't stop rappin'
Girl, that's your life
Talkin' about smokin' that glass pipe
Players was the wickedest
And that's the realler
But I still came hard on coke dealers
Raw, uncut & X Rated 'born to mack, Life Is Too $hort is where I first went platinum
$Hort dog's in the house came next
And $horty the pimp makes 7 bitch...

And it don't stop to the beat, baby...
Get In Where You Fit In bitch!'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
