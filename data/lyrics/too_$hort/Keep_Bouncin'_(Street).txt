$Hort, $hort Dawg in the house

West Coast, make 'em bounce

I'ma bounce wit'cha though, yo
We gon' bounce everywhere we go
Make a, make a wanna bounce

Get loose, get 'round, now get set
Yeah, it's the anthem, anthem
You can get crunk, get hyphy, get fit
You can bounce like you're hoppin' over
You're hoppin' over a fence

If you in the whip, ghost ride the ***
Slip into the liquor sto', sippin' on a fifth
Yeah, bring in the bag
Gangbang on you mother mothers claimin' the flag

West Coast, Coast, I'm a real go-getter
40 ounce sipper, the Blackjack tripper
20 Cripper, 10 to 1, I flip her
Got the hook-up on the birds an' the muh*** zippers

Go to the club with my thugs, sell ***
An' I might get a girl but I ain't gon' tip
Get malt liquor, spit, mo' slicker
Put y'all hands in the air, ***, it's a stick up

Naw, eat a ***
Say you a pimp but you in love with a stripper
Just bounce to the beat an' don't pay me no attention
Just bounce to the beat, bounce, bounce to the beat

It, it makes me wanna bounce to the beat
It makes me wanna bounce to the beat
It makes me wanna bounce, bounce, bounce to the beat
I'm all up in the club
E'rybody, body, body, wanna, wanna mean mug

Make a, make a wanna bounce, bounce
Make a, make a wanna bounce, bounce
Doggy Dogg, turn it out, bounce
$Hort, $hort Dawg in the house

Yeah, make a, make a wanna bounce, bounce
Make a, make a wanna bounce, bounce
Doggy Dogg turn it out, bounce
$Hort, $hort, $hort Dawg in the house

I told the DJ, play her song
Watch her choose up, put a player on
Put her in the wifey zone
She could be my girlfriend all night long

Keep bouncin', the floor is sweatin'
I'm all on her booty, I know I'm gettin' it
We from the West Coast, we live fun lives
Freak these, these till the sunrise

What time is it? Late night
Send her back home when it's daylight
Her *** at the house with a cake like
Captain Save-a, Save-a but she ain't right

She like to play 'Hard To Get'
She don't wanna dance, she wants some hard ***
Well, give her what she wants
Stick it in the *** an' watch her go dumb

Make a, make a wanna bounce, bounce
$Hort Dawg, turn 'em out, bounce
Don't you, don't you wanna bounce? Bounce
Snoop, Snoop Dogg in the house

Make a, make a wanna bounce, bounce
$Hort Dawg, turn 'em out, bounce
Don't you, don't you wanna bounce? Bounce
Will.I., Will.I., Will.I.Am in the house

I'm in the house an' I ain't movin' out
The girls keep more of my name in they mouth
I like *** best when they poppin' out
So girl, bring 'em out, bring 'em out, I make 'em bounce

Keep, keep bouncin', yeah, just keep them bouncin'
Open up your mind an' accept what I'm announcin'
If we have a President's Day an' a Veteran's Day
Let's have a *** Holiday

An' *** everyday through the weekend
I like *** like fish like sippin'
Watchin' boobies bounce is my favorite tradition
When I'm up in the club just sittin' an' wishin'

Them boobies was bouncin' on my head, my head
Them boobies was bouncin' on my head, my head
Bouncin', bouncin' on my head, my head
I want them boobies bouncin' on my head, my head

Okay, now let me change the subject
I usually don't be gettin' mannish up in public
But that's aight 'cause I'm chillin' with my folks
From the West Coast, $hort Dawg's in the house

Snoop Dogg's in the house, in the house
Too, Too $hort's in the house, in the house
Will.I.Am's in the house, in the house
West Coast make 'em bounce

It makes me wanna bounce to the beat
It makes me wanna bounce to the beat
It makes me wanna

It, it makes me wanna bounce to the beat
It makes me wanna bounce
