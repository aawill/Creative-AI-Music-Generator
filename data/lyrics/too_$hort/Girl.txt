Girl, girl, girl
That's your life
Girl
Smoking that glass pipe

I come from the city of dope
It couldn't be saved by john the pope
'Cause the base head lyric sees the light
Two fat raps to the head last night
Cocaine cocaine, is that your rap
Every day and night it's coming back
C-o-c-a-i-n-e
The rich man's high what it used to be
But things looking different in eighty-five
Cocaine, cocaine is that your high
Since age thirteen what have I seen
A lotto of base heads straight coke fiends
Snorting, puffing, that's the life
But it's all over when you hit that pipe
Big coke dealers on the knock
All smoked up with no more rocks
Base heads buy, coke from him
But he smokes more than all of them
The big coke man, ain't too cool
He smokes more than all you fools
He's gotta a lotta do, but not a lotta bank
A brand new car with an empty tank
Pretty white smoke all in his chest
And a 84 benz, reposessed

Girl, that's your life
Girl smoking that glass pipe

Fresh young tender only fifteen
Walking on a strip just wanna be seen
Never touch coke a day in her life
But now that girl's gotta have her pipe
'Cause she met a man his name was jock
Do it to her a good and he smoked a rock
Put it in her joint all crunched up
And now everyday she takes a puff

Girl, that's your life
Girl smoking that glass pipe

I know you know what coke can do
Come into your life and take over you
Now you kicking back thinking bout your dream
But it never comes true 'cause you're just a coke fiend
You asked your woman what's the prob
She said it's you 'cause you don't do your job
Used to make good love from the start
But now coke had done damage to your private parts

Girl, that's your life
Girl smoking that glass pipe

Your mind is gone your brain is blazed
You've been wide awake for the last three days
Inhale, exhale you don't care
Coke smoke only no fresh air
You can't even talk you don't wanna listen
You and your body on that cocaine mission
Three days straight where's your mind
It's gonna out of town and your brain is fried
Just smoke and choke until you're broke
Just smoke that coke until you croke
And it would be, I can't lie
No great loss if you should die
'Cause your life is wrecked, you girl is checked
She chose on my and I was set
I took her home to make my move
But she wanted to base she was just like you''''''''''''''''''''''
