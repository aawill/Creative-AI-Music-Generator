I love to see you dance, do it your way
Shake that, girl, you know it's okay
I just wanna know if you'll strip
Make a real player wanna give you a tip

You move so sexy, I love the way you wiggle
Bounce around and your big booty jiggles
Make the video, it's official
Throw the stiff girls out the game, blow the whistle

I only f*** with money makers, the hustlers
Girls who know how to get motherf***
You tryin' hard, you put everythin' into it
Can't understand how these other h*** do it

You ain't got no name brand s***
Tryin' to be fly but you ain't that ***
You've gotta want it to get it
Give a trick some booty tell him put somethin' wit it

Get down on it good if you a shaker
I see you got him where you want him, get your cake up
Drop it down to the flo' and get your paper
'Cause you a thoroughbred, you's a money maker

Now let me see you pop that ***, girl, shake that ***
Do a nasty dance, girl, make that cash
Bend that *** ovah and touch the flo'
He gotta tip if he want some mo', tip that booty
Shake that a***, girl

Yeah, shake that a***
You're like the 84 but rich 'cause it's sittin' on glass
Ain't nothin' happenin' but tricks gettin' broke
A lot of politicians but she never go vote

Got a lot of contacts
Every n*** that she f*** got some kind of contract
R&B singers, ballplayers and rappers
Tricks call back 'cause the b*** got a snapper

I'm tryin' to get the b*** to chew
It's payday, ***, you done paid your dues
You're scrapin' up your knees, climbin' up the pole
Yeah, you a *** but you just ain't out on the stroll

Get down on it good if you a shaker
I see you got him where you want him, get your cake up
Drop it down to the flo' and get your paper
'Cause you a thoroughbred, you's a money maker

Now let me see you pop that ***, girl, shake that ***
Do a nasty dance, girl, make that cash
Bend that *** ovah and touch the flo'
He gotta tip if he want some mo', tip that booty
Shake that a***, girl

I'm checkin' these ***, like checkin' accounts
I'm checkin' for checks, get checks and I bounce
I f*** with the vets, lot of money to count
My h*** be stressed, put a gun in her mouth

Bring it to me, see I need it all
I need another Benz, h**, 'em all
I *** with Chad, I *** with Todd
Bein' trill ***, baby, this our *** job

I can meet her today, be in love by tonight
You can bet by tomorrow she'll be traffickin' white
She wanna *** with me for the rest of her life
'Cause when I *** her she tell me it's the best in her life

It's Ricky Ross, you know my steez
Still holdin' ki's like your *** holdin' these
I'm a Dade County Chevy rider
But I gotta Benz that's f*** up everybody

Get down on it good if you a shaker
I see you got him where you want him, get your cake up
Drop it down to the flo' and get your paper
'Cause you a thoroughbred, you's a money maker

Now let me see you pop that ***, girl, shake that ***
Do a nasty dance, girl, make that cash
Bend that *** ovah and touch the flo'
He gotta tip if he want some mo', tip that booty
Shake that a***, girl''''''''''''''''
