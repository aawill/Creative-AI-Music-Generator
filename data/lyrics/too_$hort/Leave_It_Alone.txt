Thinking I'm washed up trying to peel my cap

Short dogg's on the mic spitting real shit
Seen my videos lately got my greal fix

From the eastside nigga, I kill a hoe
If shorty b ain't funky when he play that bass

Jumped in the plane with a pocket full of bomb

And if I run you off the road run blow your horns again

Riding in some brand new shit you know
From the eastside bitch oakland

But better stop sleepin' on the dangerous crew
I know you and your boys love to rhyme and it's funny
'Cause I spent all my time and money
On my studio we make funky ass music and we do these hoes
We freestyle and you see we get paid
You bring your bitch around I bet a g she stays
Big trucks, caddies, lexus, benz
Me and my partners fucking the friends
We got the weed the drink the money the bitchs
Still smoking zags no phillys no switchs
Three thousand miles away from the o
Smoking fluffy ass light green indo

And she's loving it
You just a broke ass rapper now you dub in it
And when I see a fine ass I be up in it nigga
