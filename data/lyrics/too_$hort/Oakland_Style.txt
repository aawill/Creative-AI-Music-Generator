Yeah! that's how we do it in oaktown, baby...
$Hort dog's on the microphone...
Straight from the east side...

I'm a player, bitch, oakland style
They call me playboy $hort, I know it's been a while
Since dangerous crew took the time to say hello
Mothafuckas makin' money in the ghetto
It's just another day and it's way too real
All my bitches cut, so what? that's how I feel
It's all good so just make me rich
And get in where you fit in, bitch
Well, I get high cause that's what I do
What about you? tell me is it true?
I heard you was through, your ass went broke
Jewerly got pawned and your cars got sold
But on the long run you got nothin' to prove
Life to me is like a funk in the groove
You gotta get right in where you belong
Find a right mission and ride the song

Ride it... oakland style... bitch!''''''''''''''''
