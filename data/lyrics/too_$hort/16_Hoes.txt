When I was 16, used to *** hoodrats
It's not a big thing
A few years later did some major upgradin'
See a top-notch, I say, "Hey, what's up, baby?"

16 ***, can't find your lost ***?
She's probably with $hort playin' at the golf course
Another ego, a hole-in-one
The game ain't borin', my h*** are fun

I got 16 *** all nicknamed ***
Make Daddy happy, y'all get that d***
Since they're everywhere, you figure I'll stop
Couldn't be a better player than me, I got 16 ***''''''''''''''''
