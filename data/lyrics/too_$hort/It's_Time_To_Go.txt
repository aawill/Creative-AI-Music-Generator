It's time to go
It's time to go
It's time to go
It's time to go

The lights are on, the club is closed
You don't wanna leave 'cause you love the h***
Somethin' ain't right, you doin' bad tonight
You'll be all alone if you don't have a wife

'Cause these ladies ain't feelin' you
They don't wanna know what you can really do
They just wanna make you disappear
Get the f*** up out a b*** ear

Take that s*** back over there
Go away, she don't wanna know you, player
What you gotta say? Just like this
Loud as you can, say, "F*** that b***"

Five minutes ago, you was thinkin' would she
Roll out with you and give you some
I don't think that's goin' down
But you don't wanna go home now

(It's time to go)
Get up outta my face
You better get up outta my face
Get up outta my face
You need to get up outta my face

(It's time to go)
Get up outta my face
You better get up outta my face
Get up outta my face
You need to get up outta my face
(It's time to go)

You came to my house with a maxi pad
You goin' home in a taxi cab
No more limos, run the meter
We might need stitches, this one's a bleeder

Grab yo' s***, girl, it's time to go
You look good but you ain't my kind of h***
Another time on another day
We could hook up, make love and play

It really can't happen no other way
Girl, do you hear what a brotha say?
Don't leave anything in my room
I got another freak, she'll be here soon

She might not be as wild you
It's 4 A.M. and right now she'll do
She's not a super freak and she's not a h***
But when she gets here, you gotta go

(It's time to go)
Get up outta my face
You better get up outta my face
Get up outta my face
You need to get up outta my face

(It's time to go)
Get up outta my face
You better get up outta my face
Get up outta my face
You need to get up outta my face
(It's time to go)

We did what we did so let's do what we do
We had fun but now I'm through with you
I gotta run, I'll call you in a few days
I'll be back to get some more

'Cause you do it better than most
At this rate, we'll probably never be close
But that's okay 'cause that's not the mission
You could cheat on your man if you got permission

I'll give it to ya, I'll beat it so well
When we finished, we gotta leave the hotel
That's all, I'm the number one player
You can call or I'll see you somewhere

As long as we make this happen again
Yo' fine a*** sittin' back in the Benz
'Cause yours is the best, I must confess
But right now, it's time to get dressed

(It's time to go)
Get up outta my face
You better get up outta my face
Get up outta my face
You need to get up outta my face

(It's time to go)
Get up outta my face
You better get up outta my face
Get up outta my face
You need to get up outta my face
(It's time to go)

You need to get on up outta my face
You gotta go, it's time to go
You need to get on up outta my face
It's time to go, it's time to go'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
