You know we ridin', yeah we ridin'
I got my nigga MC Breed in the house
Big Baller, what you ridin' boy, what you ridin'?

I got some candy paints sittin' on these
Platinum pieces and some hoe's from over seas
A mansion, a yacht, and some G's
Everything about you, thousand motto nigga, yeah
Can't even tell you what I make a year

I got some candy paints sittin' on these
Platinum pieces and some hoe's from over seas
A mansion, a yacht, and some G's
Everything about you, thousand motto nigga, yeah
Can't even tell you what I make a year

What can you ask for than just to be professional
When rap is my collateral, for this cash flow
I got some candy paints sittin' on these
Platinum pieces and some hoe's from over seas
A mansion, a yacht, and some G's
To be respected for the past and the present

Uh, and show my ass at every session
(Yeah)
And sure enough, 'm gettin' closer to my destin'
(What?)
(Nigga, Breed you ain't shit)
No interruptions only testin'
(But I do)

Uh, prove that I'm smooth with an aseditive
Bumpin' just a little bit better than my competitor
Hard you better than, you ain't gotta say it is
Everyday that's the way it is, keep it Manist

Back for some of that, Breed when the funk shit
All up in yo' ass and get cash yo' ass bump this
Bob and weave MCs never could handle me
Thinkin' bout' changin' my name to Scandal-la, you follow

Now get the paper with my motto them niggas need to get in position
And go on and hate me if you gotta
Gotta meal won't you have a plate, I'll have you wait
Go on and sit inside my Lincoln while I navigate

I got some candy paints sittin' on these
Platinum pieces and some hoe's from over seas
A mansion, a yacht, and some G's
Everything about you, thousand motto nigga, yeah
Can't even tell you what I make a year

Mackin' in my lac and when I stack 'em in the back
I don't give them bitches slack, 'cause if she's in my Cadillac
She'll be giving up the crack tryin' get a niggas scratch
When she suck a million dicks the bitch'll get a platinum plack

I said, ?Biatch, that's what I said when I grabbed
Her pony tail and she was givin' me head?
I said, ?Biatch, you know what's up I put my dick
In my draws' and zipped my jeans up?

And instantly, you finna' see how pimpishly
I get these hoe's in the streets
You niggas killin' me, you ain't feelin' me?
The bitch got you burnin' smokin' penicillin weed

Or dip yo' dick in some Hennessey
You'll be a God damned fool if you listen to me
I tell you shit that you can't believe
I got the bad ass bitches and they stankin' free

I got some candy paints sittin' on these
Platinum pieces and some hoe's from over seas
A mansion, a yacht, and some G's
Everything about you, thousand motto nigga, yeah
Can't even tell you what I make a year

I told Breed these young niggas think we gettin' old
I seen 'em gettin' gas down on Cascade Road
Still makin' money in these new days
Used to have sky pagers now we got two-ways

We dipped to my house and let the beat crank
So many placks on the wall you can't see the paint
But it's loud, you know how wild your friends get
Ballin' so long been through three body styles and big Benz's

If I cut it, in the garage
I'll make the bitch think I'm the Wizard of Oz
Click yo' heels three times you swear you seen magic
Now she's a star, she used to be a maget

Her pussy went platinum, that's what I heard
Like when I'm rappin', you never get enough of my word
I'm in my third decade of gettin' paid to rap
Back in the day my tapes stained the deck

I got some candy paints sittin' on these
Platinum pieces and some hoe's from over seas
A mansion, a yacht, and some G's
Everything about you, thousand motto nigga, yeah
Can't even tell you what I make a year

I got some candy paints sittin' on these

Everything about you, thousand motto nigga, yeah

This shit bumpin' mine ain't it, oh you gotta be riders
If you wanna bum, this Short dog shit
You can't be in no little bullshit ass car with no bullshit system
What you ridin' nigga, you got candy? You got rims nigga?
Yo' beat ain't bumpin' nigga, this shit bumpin', turn that shit up, biatch''''''''''''''''
