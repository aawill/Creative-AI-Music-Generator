I had a super bad chick, she kept runnin' her mouth
Kept talkin' all bitch, so I cut that bitch off
Fire, ho, these hoes know I'm the man when I walk through
Alex just paid me 80 grand for a walkthrough
30 chains on, Boosie keep these hoes lookin'
I could have the whole strip club, so I don't need your pussy
My exes talkin' 'bout when I was young and moved that dope
They ain't got me no more, you a woulda coulda shoulda ass ho
I'm so hot, so hot, you know, since I've been home they call me hot sauce
Straight goon, it ain't nothin' to get you knocked off
Foreign with the top off, runnin' since I got out
I can't get that fire head, I'ma cut your ass off
Period, you say I ain't the man then you're delirious
"Boosie you just gon' cut me off?" I told you I was serious
Told you take the shot, girl, so you can't have no period
But you ain't listen, it's consequences

Bitch I'm from West Side, Tree Top Bompton
You ain't shit, actin' like you faithful but you're everybody's bitch
Everybody done hit, everybody did somethin'
Your ass butt naked, that's why I cut you off
I know the situation, I don't need no explanations
Lyin' to me like I was slow, bitch this ain't The Matrix
I got the naked pictures, yeah the ones you sent to everybody
You was hoin' so much, a nigga couldn't care about you

You thought I was playin' when I cut that bitch off
I'm just tryna get inside that hole like you're golf
Oh that girl too nasty, she gon' suck it 'til it's soft
Runnin' 'round with balls, woulda thought this was lacrosse
You can't tell me ain't the hottest in your city, that I know
I see these niggas hatin' but they love it on the low
Every city that I hit, them bitches, they're in the front row
I asked myself "Why he mad", but I found out that's his ho, that I know

It ain't nothin' to cut that bitch off
