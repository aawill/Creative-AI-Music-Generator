I want your girl, she's so damn fine
She's sexier and looks way better than mine
I want your girl, she wants me too
And if you don't let her go, I'll take her from you

Watchin' that a*** made me lose my breath
She can leave with me, go cruise in my whip
Take her clothes off and do her like hell
If I don't take your girl, who would I get?

And it looked like crack
I said, ?Here, brush your teeth with this?
And now she's soakin' wet, what's next?
Me and your girl havin' sex

I told her she could get it
She told me she was wit it
She know I want to hit it
Come back braggin', tell the homies I did it

I wish I could
Bang in the *** like it's my hood
I'm strapped for the drive-by
Turn her out with this 'Up All Night' life

I want your girl, she's so damn fine
She's sexier and looks way better than mine
I want your girl, she wants me too
And if you don't let her go, I'll take her from you

The grind is a terrible thang to waste
Try not to catch me a case
Quarters, dimes, nickels and eighths
Parked in my lark at 3 A.M. in the dark
Gettin' my *** but here come the NARC

Ooh, tellin' me to depart
Went to school with the ***, used to be a mark
See me on the moon, skippin' and skatin'
Burnin' Pirelli meat, gassin' and brakin'

Strikin' through the trap with my beanie cap
With a throwaway 9 and some D in the back
E'ryday livin', livin' life as a savage
Fistfights and gun battles
'Cause it come with the package

Well above average, mack game impeccable
Don't blame me if ya broad wanna get sexual
She got her legs on a player shoulder
Back bent like she doin' yoga

She's so damn fine
She's sexier and looks way better than mine
I want your girl, she wants me too
And if you don't let her go, I'll take her from you

Dolla, she ain't never seen a hustler like this
15 karats on the right wrist
And ain't no tellin' what's on the other hand
I'm like T.I., I keep a 'Rubberband'

I'm eatin', them n*** is fastin'
I f*** off a rack on a pair of Fendi glasses
It ain't nuttin' 'cause I'm Dolla Will
I keep a *** lookin' like she from Brazil

Some n*** try but it's in me
If that's the kush she slip, then I'ma knock Jimmy
I'm in the club, found one that's friendly
She say she with her man but tryin' to come with me

I want your girl, she's so damn fine
She's sexier and looks way better than mine
I want your girl, she wants me too
And if you don't let her go, I'll take her from you

Beep beep, it's me
The yellow bus rider, Mr. F.A.B.
I'm the dumbest of dummies that do it but with P's
Let me borrow your broad, let me borrow your b***

Give it here, pimpin', I'll give her back
Leave her used, bruised, confused front to the back
'Beat It' like Mike Jack, I bet you won't like that
She lead them right back, man, where your wife at?

Uh, I like the way that she lookin'
And I don't care if she stolen, wifed or tooken
I ain't trippin', I'ma take her down
Got the game from Mom and Dad and Gangsta Brown

I mean, I thought, I'm still thinkin'
Hop in my scraper, what you smoke, what you drinkin'?
Do me 'cause I'ma sho' do you
What it, dookie? Yadda daa, boo boo

I want your girl, she's so damn fine
She's sexier and looks way better than mine''''''''''''''''
