Too $hort:
Tell 'em what we do in here, Dangerous...

Get some drums from a break and then break yo' ass.
You want beats from the crew? We'll take yo' cash
5 G's for a muthafuckin' song
And if you can't pay it, keep movin' on
I'm into somethin' that your fake ass never can handle
With your SP-12 and your raggedy samples
Better stick with the James Brown and pay him
'Cause the JD 800 ain't even playin'
Unless Pee Wee hit them keys
Ant Banks on the beats, now we makin' G's
$Horty B got the bass and we sellin' it
Shit kinda fat like a muthafuckin' elephant
Sample that shit if you want
You better try to sample this dangerous funk
'Cause ain't nobody trippin' on your fake ass tape
Should've got some beats from my nigga Ant Banks
But Banks ain't thinkin' 'about no weak shit
Now your goin' out like MC Bitch
And ain't nothin' worth killin' like a sucker
Why you wanna make fake beats, muthafucker
Should've came real like the Oakland city
Beat your ass to death with a S950
It's not a James Brown loop, it's not Parliament
But you can smell it cause it sho' got a funky scent
It's called The Dangerous Crew, make you feel stupid
Play a thousand records and you still can't loop it
'Cause it's not to be found, but if you do
Nothin' you could try make you sound like the crew.

Pee Wee:
Geah man
Just another gangsta kickin' tha player pimp shit for 9 trey.

When you're with The Dangerous Crew
Bitches wanna hang with you
Think about the thing in you
She can suck a thing or 2
Niggas in other gangs wanna hang with you
Learn your slang, made a few fools wanna slang, would you
Tell them bitches they sang or would you
Lie to get that thing 'cause they gameless
Them aimless, niggas get extinguished
But they're just muthafuckers
Got bitches duckin' suckers
When we come to town, mayn
We rollin' fat with dank, ain't fuckin' with that brown thing
To $horty B & $hort, we goin' international
Fuck the local fashion show
Niggas can't be broke
Mhisani for the money fuck a bitch until she dizzy
And me and the bigged-Banks is gettin' perkin' off Aliz?Big Bob's down with the crew ready to do
Any muthafucker steppin' to
F.M. Blue and Randy Austin
Your lost when
You thought that you can hang with this
Niggas, this is dangerous.

Spice 1:
I'm committin' a 187 so give me the clip and let me - pow
I'm down with The Dangerous Crew, so nigga, whatcha wanna do
The alias East Bay Gangsta, you can catch me peelin' caps
Known for killin' every muthafucker dead in my raps
Nigga, so give me the clip and let me pow one
'Cause everybody dyin' on this next fuckin' album
Dumpin' 'em up in ditches, kill the snitches
Sell a glock to a gee for these player hatin' bitches
Get's my smob on, get's my mob on
And niggas be talkin' the shit, but yo' I'm quick to get my rob on
'Cause peelin' your cap will put my dick on swoll
Muthafucker you bitch god damn ass hoe.

Ant Banks:
It's the Big Badass back on that ass, so it's on G
I'm kickin' the funky shit for the gangsta's only
Straight dangerous, we cold mack the most
Yeah bitch and we do that coast to coast
Now all the macks in the house, just grab your dick
And tell 'em funky cock hoes to have a lick
Fuckin' with the gin and juice, dick hard as a rock
Hoes block to block. So what's up with the cock?
I gotta get it goin' on till I reach my peak
With a late night freak everyday of the week
Ant Banks, the hoes keep yellin' my name
But I ain't trippin' 'cause a nigga got all the game
From the streets of Oakland, the City of Dope &
I'm hopin' that the hoes keep the pussy hole open
To a nigga like me 'cause the pussy is free
Never pay to play 'cause it's plain to see
That the big dick gangsta's in the house
And The Dangerous Crew's gonna turn it out
So everybody out there that's talkin' shit
I'm a wash my name out your mouth with my dick
'Cause it's a dangerous thing & I thought you knew
Boy, you can't fuck with the crew.

Mhisani:
Clinch your booty cheek, shut your eyes and grit your teeth
Goldy's 'bout to explode, I put your shit to cease
I'm like the wick on a stick of dynamite
Light me up when I find a mic
And watch me flow real tight while your flowin' - kinda tight
Goldy bitches comin' tighter than some virgin pussy
If I ever get loose and start suckin' please douche me
The Dangerous Crew ain't no strangers to
What these fingers do, hang his crew
A cold dead nigga changes blue
The skull and crossbones
Bitches get tossed on, niggas get flossed on
Take your mic and bury it like it's a lost bone
If you was a pussy you'd get fucked
If you was a dick you'd get circumsized
You better back the fuck up or I hurt them eyes
Fuck with Goldy you be hoe in'
With your shoulder above your stomach in a bow tie
Unbuttoned with your nipples showin'
D to the A N G E R O U S is the true test
In Oakland makin' the funk, so won't you stick to what you do best
Keep a dick in your ass and keep your 9 to 5
And don't be runnin' and rappin' about you signed to Jive
And I don't give a fuck if it angers you
Fuck you woodhogs, I'm down the $hort Dog and The Dangerous Crew
Bitch.''''''''''''''''
