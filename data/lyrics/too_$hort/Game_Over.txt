Man, what's up with these niggas out here
Mad at us 'cause we on top
I love to see niggas getting money
Better get it while the getting is good
Get it while you can, man
And stop hating me, fucking with my shit 'cause I got more hustle than you
Get yours, get yours baby

(Dr. Dre)
I'm seeing millions, niggas don't understand
Know what? I'm making moves, putting cash behind plans
To blow up, will he style like this
Everyday I parlay, sip Henne and Tanqueray
Stay in the mix like Alezay
V.I.P., my shit parked valet
On the prowl again to get honies familiar with the smile again
Some try to assault Dre, its still cavi
I'm eating steak while they struggle to break the slave mentality
I giving living definition long as my hearts ticking
I fought and made the world listen
Whatever fly Dr. Dre invented
Turn on the box and let my son watch these studio clowns on 60 inches
I push a rover, shit platinum before the sessions over
Rap master with the Houston heat holder
These players best to get they shit in check
'Cause when I get my hustle on ain't no playing with a full deck

(Chorus: x2 Ice Cube)
Lord please, murder my enemies (Yeah)
Burn 'em at a thousand degrees
And lord please let me make mo cheese
'Cause I ain't quite ready to leave (No)

(Scarface)
Buck the whole world
Meant that, gotta stay strapped
Cause 99.9 a niggas, carry they gats
Super fist fighting shit might come down to dying
When the time comes down for the trying I got nine
Reasons why niggas shouldn't step in my face
With the nonsense, 'cause I'm always heated and you can taste this
Audi little something out the seams a my trousers
With no hesitation I got a team to come clown ya
I down ya, so let your people know what they face
With the type of individual that'll bomb a sub-station
Kaboom! and everybody dies outside
There ain't no escaping the Reaper so don't try
Go ahead, close ya eyes, who the next to step?
Face down, hit, bleeding on the steps a death
Check yo self, you just been invaded by true soldiers
December 31st, 96 (the game is over)

(I've got all my life to live, plus with all my love to give)

(Dr. Dre and Scarface)
Smoking weed I never trail, I lead
Spending dough, tripped the cost of a ride like it was pocket money, Gs
But these are the things real players do
Talking shit is real things that the haters do
I'm naming you
Shit's thick, its time to run for shelter
I kept the word, things could happen to marks like it was helter skelter

Dear diary, I'm running outta pages
Fading, in and out, taking purple hazes
The dazes, Revelations in the last stages
Red sky's institute, the silent horns playing
I'm praying with tears in my eyes
'Cause I'm trying to make it into eternal peace without dying
But they eying my bank account with beams on my rover
The killer failed to launch his attack (the game is over)''''''''''''''''
