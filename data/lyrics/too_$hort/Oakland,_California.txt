Oakland, California
Oakland, California
Oakland, California

Oakland California is the city of snakes
Pimps, pussy's, players and fakes
Loud mouth bitches who talk too much
Dick teasin bitches who never fuck
Sucka ass nigga fake as hell
A man or a bitch I really can't tell
Some of you niggas need to quit
Show and tell nigga you ain't shit
Sayin' I got this and I got that
But when it comes to you I got no rap
'Cause what I see is good for me
And what I don't know just let it be
Bitches gamin workin extensions
Her hair ain't really but two inches
Bald head girls in the Oakland world
Short afros and jheri curls
Nappy head niggas like myself
Get a bald head and say go to hell
But you're a snake you're a worm
Bald head bitch you need a perm
Oakland California is the city of liars
Fresh barbed wires with vogue tires
Niggas tellin' stories twenty minutes long
And everything in it was smooth wrong
I said why you wanna tell me I don't wanna know
All I want is stereo rock
Homeboys kick it gettin' keyed
Sold that mark some fake weed
Told that nigga here you go
A big fat sack and you know it's premo
A 20-dollar bill went to your hand
You rushed that money to the coke man
To the coke bottle was the next stop
But you broke the bottle and can't smoke rock
Bass rocks bass rocks that's your daddy
You better off smokin' on a powdered cabby
Have a white christmas everyday
Cause coke can cabby is a too short way
That's too s-h-o-r-t
Smoke more coke than Richard P
Have more money than 
Oakland can I get some action
Hey young tender in the 501's
I love to see when you work your tongue
Suckin my dick in the back of the car
Rollin' down skyline boulevard
I said beeeeeeeyach
What are you smokin'
A big fat dick in the big east Oakland
I seen my homey he needs to quit
Holdin' hands with a bitch who looks like shit
Maybe I'm wrong by what I say
Maybe that nigga is gettin' paid
Maybe that ain't bein used
Gettin' fucked without collectin dues
That's how I work all the time
I'm too short baby got a fresh new rhyme
For Oakland, California that's the place
Homies got drugs all in yo face
With the opd cruise down again
Niggas goin' half off dubes and tens
On any corner anywhere
Buy your drugs from a Oakland player
Niggas sell squat callin it top
Cut cocaine get a big nigga rock
Crime went down murder went up
And some of these turfs are tryin' to get tuff
Whos the leader of the hour
Anybody livin' if they push power
M-16, 357
Sendin these niggas to hell not heaven
So much death in the Oakland streets
Your nothin' but a target sellin weed
You know I'm rappin' the honest truth
Niggas roll up shotin guns at you
Frettin your life and call you fake
Till you take your drugs to another state
And sometimes man it's a pitty
Cause a nigga used to roll in the Oakland city
Niggas who take do you know yourself
You must be the nigga with all the wealth
Maybe one day you can own this town
If everybody fucked and you are down
That's how you see it I do too
But I break bitches and you break crew
Oakland California is gettin' tuff
Niggas got schemes for comin' up
Niggas got ways to make big bank
Hit these streets like an army tank
I'm too s-h-o-r-t
Spitin more game than you'll ever speak

I got mo bitches wantin me
'Cause I'm the best dam rapper from the Oakland streets
I'm the coldest MC on a microphone
Oakland, California wont leave it alone
'Cause I'm on this mic rappin' that game
Knockin' off tapes like I'm sell cocaine
Fuckin' these freaks indefinably
I never stop fuckin' you Oakland freaks
Highschool bitches really like
The way sir too short can rock the mic
Oakland, California that's the place
Freak freak bitch got alot of ways
She got big fat tities size 38
I'm a fuck that bitch but I can't wait
The young girl makes my body boil
When I fuck that bitch I'm a drill for oil
I'm a put cocaine all over my dick
And tell that bitch it's time to lick
East Oakland that's where I live
The city of the freak freak freaky bitch
I spent the night with her she ain't mine
I fuck that bitch so many times
And that right there I could never fake
I thought my god dam dick would break
Fuckin' too much makes you hurt
But I never stuck a bitch from putin in work
All you bitches can suck me dry
Suckin my dick for the rest of your lives
Ok baby here we are
Were just two young freaks in the back of the car
You are one who's the other
It's sir too short that rappin' ass brotha
Everytime I talk to you
Whatcha wanna know is it still cool
And every time what do I state
Your still my bitch that's everyday
All you bitches 'cause I'm a hall
And you baby girl my freaky doll
I'm too short baby now I'm smokin'
Another big cabby and I'm in east Oakland
Not the west not the north
It's the eastside baby I'm sir too short
I can spit a rap and I'll create
A sucka MC everyday
Niggas from Oakland young and old
Runin round here keep off that dope
Singin' my rap at the skating rink
Sucka MC do you know what I think
You wanna be me so dam bad
You wish that you could make my rap
When I say short you say your name
Tellin' your homies you rappin' game
But I sell tapes and niggas know
You singin' my rap in stereo
Some of you niggas ain't really shit
And Tony G. is just a bitch
Why does Tony rap like me
'Cause he ain't no pass high?
Just sleep to the world on what I do
Grab a mic front you
Tony G. you just can't have it
Nothin' but little light skin oak faggot
Tryin' to rap on the mic
But too short baby is what they like''''''''''''''''
