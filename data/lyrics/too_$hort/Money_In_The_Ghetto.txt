In The Ghetto
You think life is hard
Food stamps and to' up cars
Wall to wall dirty on carpet
Sittin' in a bucket hopin' you can start it
And ride around to the liquor store
Can't get a job get drunk some more
You better stop trippin' on them stereotypes
'Cause In The Ghetto there's a good life
We ain't starvin' like marvin' won't see no roach
When you chill wit the rich folks in the hood
You sittin' on leather watchin' big screens
Bought by the dope fiends
Smokin' and what about the brother wit the good jobs
Save money and workin' hard
Bought a house for his wife and kids
You only got 1 life to live
Another brother got some cocaine
You know his face but don't know his name
You know he got the sack man
And he's sittin' on a phat bank
Sellin' cars at his house in the driveway
Bein' so clean don't roll it just fly away
'Cause folks got Money In The Ghetto
Yeah you know.

Hey hey hey.
Whatcha got to say?
It's Money In The Ghetto

"Havin' Money In The Ghetto."

Money In The Ghetto ain't nothin' new
It's been like that way before you
Was even born get up for the down stroke
Chocolate city for the black folks
Say it loud in your hot pants
Man child in the promise land
I take you back to iceberg's land
And all the players that came before him.
If you a everyday hustler, get'cha money
'Cause what they do to black man ain't funny
All the time tryin' to put us the pen
You get parole and then they send you again
All the homies in the hood gettin' paid
You might have left but the Money stayed
In The Ghetto it ain't all about drugs
Gettin' paid doin' all kind of stuff
Only rule on the street is don't get caught
Unless you hustle ain't breakin' the law
And even though rich folks got it good
We're sittin' on it phat in the hood
I'm ridin' on some gold ones
Smokin' dank and it's potent
Ask them fools 'cause they know
It's Money In The Ghetto.

Hey hey hey.

I got money baby just tell me the price
Cause $hort dawg ain't nuttin' nice
I always hit the town wit my boy Ben Franklin
Spend fo' get an ounce a dank then
Rich nigga get high relaxin'
And if I bust a Ben Frank get some Andrew Jackson's
5 20's for a hundred dollar bill
You know the math let's make a deal
On a $1 bill if you look on the front
You find the face of George Washington
Make money baby that's all I do
That's how I know Thomas Jefferson is on the 2
Abraham Lincoln got shot and died
Freed the slaves so they put him on the 5
And how much in my old time friend
They put his face on the front of the 10
They are the dead presidents
From the hood and they represent
The American dream for the average monority
Makin' money get some weed & a 40
I'm on the east side livin' like a king
Kick back watch a 50 inch screens
Bounce to the west side and hit studio
And spend my Money In The Ghetto.

Hey hey hey.

Nowadays if you can't say a rap, or play sports
You might just come up short
And they always say the same things
Don't be a gangsta or a dope fiend
Get your High School diploma, go to college
Get a degree and start makin' dollars
Only 1 thing wrong and it's a trip
Inner city schools don't teach us shit
Got us stuck on stupid, straight S.O.S.
Can't get nothin' but they payin' the rest of them fools
All around the world in the other countries
They should be spendin' that money right here
In the state of California
You graduate and can't spell diploma
Dip to the hood and get rich
Slangin' rocks to a smoked out bitch
No school'll come close to that
A few transaction make my pockets fat
I make alot of money and it ain't no lie
I'll probably ball till the day I die
And if I didn't. So What?
I bet you I'd still come up
Cause there's a whole lot of Money In The Ghetto... yeah you know.

Hey hey hey.
