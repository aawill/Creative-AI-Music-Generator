I ain't gotta say much, $hort
So you wanna be a baller?
David Banner, Big Face
You wanna get paid?

You gotta keep tryin', just don't give up
Can't get on your feet 'cause you just won't get up
You dream about havin' nice things but you don't have a plan
How you gon' get it, from your Uncle Sam?

Your welfare check can't buy a house and a Benz
What'chu wanna be, a mouse or a man?
You need a hustle, somethin' that'll make some cash
Don't step on the gas, you're goin' way too fast

In your new sports car, you're dreamin' again
Snap out of it, I know you're fiendin' to win
You need to start from the beginnin', get a paper and pen
What'chu like to do, what's your favorite thing?

There's gotta be somethin' you can do wit'cha life
Sell things that a whole bunch of people will buy
Make a lot of profits, make bank deposits
Wanna live like this, here's a shoe, how's it fit?

How you gon' ball if you got no hustle?
How you gon' pimp if you got no game?
How you win a fight if you know you can't tussle
Your life ain't right 'cause you so damn lame

Now how you gon' ball if you got no hustle?
How you gon' pimp if you got no game?
How you win a fight if you know you can't tussle?
Your life ain't right 'cause you so damn lame

Wanna play with they life but won't play with they kids
They'll ball for these *** but won't invest ***
Go to church and pray to blue eyes, church is for them pew thighs
Supersized by fries, I pimp a lot of ***

But I'd rather save yo' lives
I'm from a place where they hung black folks
Where a bird can be whipped from some raw endo
Now you broke 'cause you smoke and you don't got a job

Man, get up off yo' a*** and do just like Todd
Sell yo' *** up out the trunk
Stop hatin' other ***, you can get what you want
You can get what you need without makin' others bleed
I'm the master of the P U S S E

Oops, I meant Y, others gotta die
Just to help sorry-*** lames get by
Now you'll let a bird die if you saw a bush
But you're *** in the hood, come get douched

How you gon' ball if you got no hustle?
How you gon' pimp if you got no game?
How you win a fight if you know you can't tussle
Your life ain't right 'cause you so damn lame

Now how you gon' ball if you got no hustle?
How you gon' pimp if you got no game?
How you win a fight if you know you can't tussle?
Your life ain't right 'cause you so damn lame

When you finally start makin' some dough
You gotta work a lot harder, way more than befo'
It ain't hard to get in but it's hard to stay
When you start pimpin', it's all night, all day

Non-stop, gettin' it, then you start kickin' it
Out with some ***, later on, you'll be stickin' it
Move forward and continue to do what men do
Gettin' money 'cause it's in you

Or maybe bein' a man ain't in you, you ***
You can sell out your own just so you can get rich
No soul, no vibe but you sportin' a cross
Man, the truth is you're tired and your spirit is lost

I've been baptized in dirt, pull your panties up
Rather shoot ya in your mind instead of blowin' out your liver
David Banner, Mississippi, to the day that I die
You can make it in this world, stand up, *** try

How you gon' ball if you got no hustle?
How you gon' pimp if you got no game?
How you win a fight if you know you can't tussle
Your life ain't right 'cause you so damn lame

Now how you gon' ball if you got no hustle?
How you gon' pimp if you got no game?
How you win a fight if you know you can't tussle?
Your life ain't right 'cause you so damn lame''''''''''''''''
