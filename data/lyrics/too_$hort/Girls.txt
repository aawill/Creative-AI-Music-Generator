Right, all right
Right, all right
Right, all right
Right, right, right

I'm single in the streets bout to get it in
Talking bout some drinking and some mingling
Can't believe what I'm seeing, man, all these girls, look, look
Hmm get in the car y'all just wanna make her feel hot
Let me smell your sin girl damn you look so
No groupies, see a blonde girl with a brunette
See a nigga cruising in the red benz
That's a one, two, double up, triple up
So many surprises oh so many colours and sizes
Love them, I want them, they need me
I'm rolling, coasting

I see pretty girls everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go
So many colours and sizes, so many surprises

I see pretty girls everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go

I see pretty girls everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go

So many colours and sizes, so many surprises
I see pretty girls everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go

Guess what, a nigga turnt up
All the windows closed for the roast up
Club club letting out feelin' post up
All I need is somebody to fly with and smoke this tree
Down for doing acid
Slim up on that waist, but that ass fit
Let me feel your skin on mine unwind what's on your mind
And tell me somethin' that moves me
Seen all types, different continents
Nothing more intriguing than an accent
That's a one, two, double up, get it up
So many surprises, so many colours and sizes
Love them (mmh) they're so dope, they're so dope
We're rolling, coasting

I see pretty girls everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go
I see pretty girls everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go
I see pretty girls everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go
I see pretty girls everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go

When you live like me, you get used to fun
There's an endless supply of the beautiful ones
Open up those exotic thighs
The baddest little bitch half-black, half-thai
Don't be prejudiced, 'cause she's mixed
I'd still fuck the blackest bitch
That's how it is if you in my world
Light skin, white momma you a white girl
And I got that fever
And a big thick you know what I wanna feed her
Met a girl named maria, it's your turn, I love them senoritas
I like to fuck 'em, but then I said fuck 'em
Lil momma can get a little something
Og too short don't stop
All the pretty girls call me todd

I see pretty girls everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go (let me see that body)
I see pretty girls everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go
I see pretty girls everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go
I see pretty girls everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go

They love me
