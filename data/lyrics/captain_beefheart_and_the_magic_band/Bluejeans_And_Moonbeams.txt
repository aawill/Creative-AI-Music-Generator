I been hopin' on Mondays
Some how's and Moondays
Sunday's and Some days
Never seeing some days
I'm tryin' in all ways
And learnin' in between

Blue jeans and Moonbeams
Blue jeans and Moonbeams

I been working up in lovin'
Underneath the moonstone sky
I know there's many things I've never seen

Blue jeans and Moonbeams
Mondays and Moonbeams
Blue jeans and Moonbeams
Blue jeans and Moonbeams

I been hopin' on Mondays
Some how's and Moondays
Sunday's and Some days
Never seeing some days
I'm tryin' in all ways
And learnin' in between

Blue jeans and Moonbeams
Blue jeans and Moonbeams

I been working up in lovin'
Underneath the moonstone sky
I know there's many things I've never seen

Blue jeans and Moonbeams
Mondays and Moonbeams
Blue jeans and Moonbeams
Mondays and Moonbeams''&''''&''''&''&''''
