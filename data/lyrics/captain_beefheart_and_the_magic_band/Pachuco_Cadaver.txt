A squid eating dough in a polyethylene bag is fast and bulbous, got me?

When she wears her bolero then she begin to dance
All the pachucos start withholding hands
When she drives her Chevy, sissies don't dare to glance
Yellow jackets and red devils buzzing 'round her hair hive ho

She wears her past like a present
Takes her fancy in the past
Her sedan skims along the floorboard
Her two pipes humming carbon cum

Got her wheel out of a B-29 Bomber
Brody knob amber
Spanish fringe and talcum tassles
Forever amber

She looks like an old squaw Indian
She's ninety-nine she won't go down
Avocado green and alfalfa yellow
Adorn her to the ground

Tattoos and tarnished utensils
A snow white bag full of tunes
Drives a cartoon around
Drives a cartoon around

Broma seltzer blue umbrella
Keeps her up off the ground
Round red sombreros
Wrap her high tap horsey shoes

When she unfolds her umbrella
Pachucos got the blues
Her loving makes me so happy
If I smiled I'd crack my chin

Her eyes are so peaceful
Thinks it's heaven she been
Her skin is as smooth as the daisies
In the center where the sun shines in
Smiles as sweet as honey
Her teeth as clean as the combs where the bees go in

When she walks, flowers surround her
Let their nectar come in to the air around her
She loves, her love sticks out like stars
Her loving stick out like stars''''''''''''''''''''''
