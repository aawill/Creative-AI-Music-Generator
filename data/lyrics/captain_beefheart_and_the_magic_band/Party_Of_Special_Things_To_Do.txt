The camel wore a nightie...
At the party of special things to do

When the stiff wind blows
The flag don't wiggle
In the party of special things to do

I met the Ace of Love
She took me to her plantation
For love without separation
In the party of special things to do
I could happen to me
It could happen to you

I met the Ace of Love
She said I want you to go
To a party of special things to do
And when you're through
I'll be right here waiting for you
Here take these sparks
So that my distant cousins can get along with you
Watch out for the Mirror Man
And Elixir Sue

Spoken: When I got to the party of special things to do it wasn't hard
To find Elixir Sue. I met all the cars, the wild cards, the One-Eye
Jills, the Red Queen. She turned her head, you know what I mean, she
Turned it back and said, "I got a brand new game I want to lay on
You..."

I met them all
At the party of special things to do
When I was done
I was far from through
I returned to the Ace of Love
Now wouldn't you?

I met them all
I met them all
I met them all
At the party of special things to do
The camel wore a nightie
At the party of special things to do...''&''''&''''&''&''''
