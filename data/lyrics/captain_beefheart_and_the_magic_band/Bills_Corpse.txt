Quietly the rain played down on last of the ashes
Quietly the light played down on her lashes
She smiled and twisted, she smiled and twisted
Hideously looking back at what once was beautiful

Playing naturally magically
Oh, her ragged hair was shinin' red white and blue
All 'n all the children screamin'
"Why surely madam you must be dreamin'
You couldn't have done this if you knew what you were doin'."

Well the gold fish in the bowl lay upside down bloatin'
Full in the sky and the plains were bleached white with skeletons
Various species grouped together according to their past beliefs
The only way they ever all got together
Was not in love but shameful grief

It's not the way I'd like it to get together
That's not the kind of thoughts I'd like to keep
The rain played lightly down, down on the formaheap

Oh lady, look up in time
Oh lady, look out of love
And you should have us all
Oh, you should have us fall''''''''''''''''''''''
