When Big Joan comes out, her arms are too small
Her head's like a ball
She tied off her horse and galloped off into the moonbeams
She pulled up her blouse and compared her navel to the moon
I dig my life for a while

When Big Joan sets up, her hands are too small
She's too fat to go out in the daylight
So she rolls around all night

I'm just sorta thread with a drooped body
I'll set up with you, Big Joan
I'm too fat to go out in the daylight, I'll stay up all night
I won't droop if you won't talk about your hands being too small

You know something's happening or you wouldn't have come out like you did
She ain't built for going naked so she can't wear any new clothes
Or go to the beach, they laugh at her body
'Cause her hands are too small

When Big Joan sets up, her hands are too small
She's out of reach

A turquoise scarf and a silver robe rolled up over a Merc Montclair

I'll sit up with you Big Joan
I'm too fat to go out in the daytime
I'll stay up all night
If you promise not to talk about your hands being too small
