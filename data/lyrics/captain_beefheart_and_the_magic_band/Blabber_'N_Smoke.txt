All you ever do is blabber 'n smoke
There's ah big pain in your window
'N all your waters turn t' rope
It gonna hang you all
Dangle you all
Dang you all
If you don't hurry there will be no hope
Why don't you quit actin' like ah dope
All you ever do is blabber 'n smoke
It don't matter where you got your start
Which side of your head you wear your heart
Clean up the air
'N treat the animals fair
I can't help but think you treat love like ah joke
Time's runnin' out
'N all you ever do is blabber 'n smoke
Blabber 'n smoke
Blabber 'n smoke''''''''''''''''''''''''
