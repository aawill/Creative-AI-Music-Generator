Phosphorus chimney burnin'
Modern-men's a-learnin'
Time and space a-turnin'
Motor's engine churnin'

Factory's no place for me
Boss man let me be

Wind and wave all blowin'
Mountain and sky showin'
Bee and flower growin'
Boy and girl are glowin'

Factory's no place for me
Boss man let me be

Factory's no place for me
Boss man let me be

Minds inside are goin'
Muscle and bone are showin'
One thing sure am knowin'
Get a fire goin'

Factory's no place for me
Boss man let me be
Boss man leave me be
Boss man leave me be''''''''''''''''
