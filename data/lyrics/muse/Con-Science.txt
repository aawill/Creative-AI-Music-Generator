I can't pretend
Choose how it ends
You slipped away
Questions you to say

In fear
In sorrow
In fear
In sorrow

I can't pretend
Consumed by an ends
Try bend the rules
Ribs out the cruels

In fear
In sorrow
In fear
In sorrow

I can't pretend
Choose how it ends
You slipped away
Questions you to stay

In fear
In sorrow
In fear
In sorrow''''''''''''''''''
