When these pillars get pulled down
It will be you who wears the crown
And I'll owe everything to you

How much pain has cracked your soul?
How much love would make you whole?
You're my guiding lightning strike

I can't find the words to say

I've traveled half the world to say
"I belong to you"

I can't find the words to say

[Mon Cur S'ouvre  Ta Voix]     (My heart opens itself to your voice)
Ah! Rponds,                     (Ah! Respond,)
Rponds  ma tendresse           (Respond to my tenderness)
Verse-moi, verse-moi l'ivresse!  (Pour out to me, pour out to me the euphoria!)
Rponds  ma tendresse!          (Respond to my tenderness!)
Rponds  ma tendresse!          (Respond to my tenderness!)
Ah! Verse-moi l'ivresse!         (Ah! Pour out to me the euphoria!)

Verse-moi, verse-moi l'ivresse!  (Pour out to me, pour out to me the euphoria!)
Rponds  ma tendresse!          (Respond to my tenderness!)
Rponds  ma tendresse!          (Respond to my tenderness!)
Ah! Verse-moi l'ivresse!         (Ah! Pour out to me the euphoria!)


I belong
I belong to you alone

"...use"

Woo!

I can't find the words to say
They're overdue
I've traveled half the world to say
"I belong to you"''''''''''''''''''''''''
