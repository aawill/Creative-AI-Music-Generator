Too many young and too many old
Too many people left you in the cold
You want everything to change
Cause you are afraid of losing

She only exists when she's on the screen
He's only alive inside a machine
We want everything to change
'Cause we are afraid of losing

Tell me do you really need this
Tell me do you really care
Tell me do you really need this
Tell me do you really care
I don't think you really need this
I don't think you really care
I don't think you really need this
I don't think you really care

Too many young and too many old
To many people left in the cold
We want everything to change
Now I'm so afraid of losing
Yeah yeah yeah''''''''''''''''''
