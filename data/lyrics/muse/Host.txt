I've read you well 
I just want to get away 
'Cause you used my love 
I just need to get away

My trust in you has been abused 
My trust in you has been overused

Sick of this space 
Wish we could be far away 
'Cause I wasted all my youth 
I'll never see it again

My trust in you has been abused 
My trust in you has been overused

I will welcome you to everything
'Cause you've bled me dry now
I just want to run away
'Cause you've bled me dry now
I just want to run away

I just wanted too much 
I wish we could be far away 
And if my wish comes true 
You'll never see me again''''''''''''''''''
