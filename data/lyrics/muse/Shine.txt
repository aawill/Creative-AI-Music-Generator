Who cares for the life we've earned?
Someone's sold all the truth you've earned.
Remember when we used to shine
And had no fear or sense of time
When it creeps up on you

You can't cry now there's nothing to feel.
No one's noticed our loneliness.
Remember when you should have teased
And made us scream eternal time.

I believed that you'd always be here
'Cause once you promised a life with no fear.
Please don't break my ideals
And say what's fake was always real.
I was ...
Take me back again.''''''''''''''''
