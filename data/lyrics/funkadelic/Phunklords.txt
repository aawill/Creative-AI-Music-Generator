We are the phunklords and we're coming to ya
Gonna hit you with a one and then
With our groove we'll move ya
Sent to you from eons away
Just to spread some funk your way
(x2)

Hey my friends, so happy to see you again
It's been a long time since we have grooved all as one
We've been strivin', stayin' just alive, stayin' just alive
We can't wait to get to your town, just to lay that funky rhythm down
'Cause we gonna bump, we gonna freak, we gonna give your feet a treat
Dancin' to a rockin' beat

Slippin' away from a ship of fools who had a captain that changed the rules
After seein' the world we lived in and what we could be givin'
Ooh we feel for you
Don't throw away your wisdom to those on the losin' side
Let their greed be their company in the shadows where they hide
Friends there are many, each one's not the same
Some are real and know the truth, to others it's just a game

We are the phunklords and we're coming to ya
Gonna hit you with a one and then
With our groove we'll move ya
Sent to you from eons away
Just to spread some funk your way

Slippin' away from a ship of fools who had a captain that changed the rules
After seein' the world we lived in and what we could be givin'
Ooh we feel for you
Don't throw away your wisdom to those on the losin' side
Let their greed be their company in the shadows where they hide
Friends there are many, each one's not the same
Some are real and know the truth, to others it's just a game

We are the phunklords and we're coming to ya
Gonna hit you with a one and then
With our groove we'll move ya
Sent to you from eons away
Just to spread some funk your way

We are descending unto you leaving a trail of truth behind us
Why don't you hop on this funk connection
So we can be a constant reminder
There's no time for writing in the book of yesterday
Love is forgiving, love is forgiving, love is forgiving
Love's shonuff forgivin', love is forgiving
(Wo oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Love is forgiving, it'll make your life worth living
Hey

We are the phunklords, we are the phunklords,
We are the phunklords,
We are the phunklords, we are the phunklords,
We are the phunklords,
We are the phunklords, we are the phunklords,
We are the phunklords''''&''''&''''&''''&''
