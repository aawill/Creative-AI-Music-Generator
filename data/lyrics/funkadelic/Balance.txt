Balance is my thing
The sun the snow
Wind and rain
Must come

Balance is my thing
The sun the snow
Wind and rain
Must come

Mother
I can see it
I can hear it
But I don't know where it's coming from

Mother
Are you sure this is the time in which we belong

Hey, mother
Don't be angry
Don't be jealous
And don't forget who is to blame

Mother
It was you
It was not me who
Created this conflicted brain

Balance is my thing
The sun the snow
Wind and rain
Must come

Hey mother
I can feel it
I can taste it
I can smell what it's all about

Hey mother
I know it's in me
All about me
But my instinct won't let it out

Hey mother
Sometimes I'm up
Sometimes I'm HIGH
And sometimes I am really down

Hey mother
What's in your plans
What's in your game
What secrets can be found

Balance is my thing
The sun the snow
Wind and rain
Must come

Hey mother
What do you mean
"Don't take it personal"
When giving all you can abide (?)

Hey mother
Am I to sit here waiting
While my brother, little brother dies?

Yes mother
I can see it
I can hear it
But I don't know where it's coming from

Hey mother
Are you sure this is the time where we belong
