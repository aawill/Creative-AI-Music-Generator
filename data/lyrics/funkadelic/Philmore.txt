Stick it!
Stick it!
Stick it!
Stick it!

Let me talk to you for a while
Lovin' my way
You're in style
And put some finish on your mind
If you're lovin'
Taste my wine
Can you feel it?
Feel it
Umm, Feel it

Listen here
Tell all your friends
And hated ones too
That we'll be there pretty soon
Philmore baby
That's all you need
Philmore
It's gonna be guaranteed
Sometimes it smells you know
Feel it!
Stick it!
Stick it Stick it Stick it

Everybody's got a problem
And you don't even give a damn
Up on you, like I said
Everybody's got a problem
But you don't even give a damn
Everybody's got a problem
But you don't even give a damn
(Mm, ha!)
Everybody's got problems
But you don't even care
You don't care and you don't care, yeah
Everybody's got a problem
(Everyone's got problems, y'all)
But you don't care and you don't care
Everybody's got problems
But you don't even give a damn
Do what you want to do
Everybody's got problems
But you don't even give a damn
Everybody's got problems
(Stop and stare, beware)
But you don't even give a damn
Everybody's got problems
(Stick it stick it)
(Good god)
But you don't even give a damn
(Philmore sometime)
Hit it''''''''''''''''''
