Are you mad, at me, darling?
Are you sorry that we, we, we met?
Have you learned to love another?
Has he told you to for, for-for-forget
But no other heart can love you
Like this broken heart
Of mine

Yeah, I've been diggin' on your vibes lately
(This broken heart of mine)
Yes, and you've been finding more faults
Than Carter got liver pills
(Broken)
And I'm hip to all that Gemini material laying around
(This broken heart of mine)
Heh
And I ain't no Gemini
(Broken broken)
I just want to make sure you ain't half-steppin'
(This broken heart of mine) and short-strokin'
Can you get to that?

Well, no other heart can love you
Like this broken heart of mine
Like this broken heart
Of mine''''''''''''''''''
