Sitting here with a broken heart
Wishing you'd come home oh
Sitting here with breakin' hearts
I just can't go on
Oh!

Grief has got a hold on me
I can't think for myself
It's all because that woman of mine
Making love to someone else

I'm turnin' green from bein' blue
Without your face around
You found another to do your lovin'
And me you have put down
And I'm

Sitting here with a broken heart
Wishing you'd come home oh
Sitting here with breakin' hearts
I just can't go on

Ooh!

I'm trudging water all through the house
I thought it was from my leakin' sink
I phoned the plumber to rush right over
And see if he could fix this leak

He rushed right over and he took a look
And much to my surprise
He said "My son it's not your sink,
It's teardrops from your eyes"
Oh!

Sitting here with a broken heart
Wishing you'd come home oh
Sitting here with breakin' hearts
I just can't go on

You can't miss what you can't measure
That's what they tried to make me see
Love's around I know for sure
What's in store for me

Sitting here with a broken heart
Wishing you'd come home oh
Sitting here with breakin' hearts
I just can't go on

Ah!

I chew my nails off one by one
I only got one to go
Unless I get what I been missin'
Nails I'll have no more
My nerves are shot I smoke a lot
In my loneliness
And until I see your face once again
My lonely heart won't rest
And I'm

Sitting here with a broken heart
Wishing you'd come home oh
Sitting here with breakin' hearts
I just can't go on

Sitting here with a broken heart
Wishing you'd come home oh
Sitting here with breakin' hearts
I just can't go on

You can't miss what you can't measure
That's what they tried to make me see
But as long as love's around
I know what's in store for me

You can't miss what you can't measure
That's what they tried to make me see
Love's around I know for sure
What's in store for me

You can't miss what you can't measure
That's what they tried to make me see
Love's around I know for sure
What's in store for me''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
