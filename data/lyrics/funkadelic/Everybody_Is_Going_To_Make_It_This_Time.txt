Our mothers and our fathers, they had lives to live
Oh, and today is proof that mistakes were made
There's not a doubt in my heart
They've done the best that they know how
And there's still time for us to make a change

We got to learn from the mistakes that were made in the past
We got to clean so that we can clean our minds
'Cause in order to get it together, we got to get our heads together
Everybody is going to make it this time
Everybody is going to make it this time

Our country and our cities, they have been betrayed for money
Ooh, and somehow the people, they will make a change, yeah
There's not a doubt in my mind, if hunger and anger place the blame
There won't be a country left to change

We got to see what we're doing in the name of comfort
We've got to see, we've got to feel the warning signs
But in order to get it together, we've got to get our heads together
Everybody is going to make it this time
Everybody is going to make it this time

We've got to learn from the mistakes that were made in the past
We've got to clean so that we can use our minds
But in order to get it together, we've got to get our heads together
Everybody is going to make it this time
Everybody is going to make it this time

(Everybody make it, yeah, whoa)
Everybody is going to make it this time
Everybody is going to make it this time
Everybody is going to make it this time

Everybody is going to make it this time
Everybody is going to make it this time
Everybody is going to make it this time
Everybody is going to make it this time

Everybody is going to make it this time
Everybody is going to make it this time
(Got to make it, this time, whoa)
(Woo, woo, woo, hey)''''''''''''''''''
