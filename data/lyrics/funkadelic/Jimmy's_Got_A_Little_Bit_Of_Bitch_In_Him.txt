Jimmy's got a little bit of bitch in him
The bitch in him upsets the Jim
Jimmy's got a little bit of bitch in him
The bitch in him outweighs the Jim
Jimmy's got a little bit of she in he
But when he pee, he see

Ah, reality can be, ah, stiff sometimes
But then again it can be flexible
Depending on the angle of the dangle
Increased by the heat of the meat
And with the proposition that all men are not created equal

So why frown
Yeah, even the sun go down
We'll call it mixed emotions for now
Play on, Jimmy

Jimmy's got a little bit of bitch in him
The bitch in him upsets the Jim
Jimmy's got a little bit of bitch in him
The bitch in him outweighs the Jim
Jimmy's got a little bit of she in he
But when he pee, he see

Ah, reality can be, ah, hard
But then again it can be, ah, swinging
Like I said, depending on the angle of the dangle
Increased by the heat of the meat
And with the proposition that all men are not created equal

So why frown
Even the sun go down
We'll call it mixed emotions for now

Jimmy's got a little bit of bitch in him
The bitch in him upsets the Jim
Jimmy's got a little bit of bitch in him
The bitch in him outweighs the Jim'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
