Come back, come back
Come back, come back

It's just another rainy day
Since my woman walked away
And now I'm left all alone
And I'm crying

I'm sorry for the change that made us grow apart
But sometimes the mind won't listen to the heart

If she's anywhere within the sound of my voice
I want her to hear my special choice
Rainy days can't cloud my mind
From the sunshine she left behind her

Come back, come back
Come back, come back

It's just another lonely night
And in the darkness
I can't find your light
As passion's faces turn a sadder blue
But through the tears
My heart keeps searching for you
If she's anywhere
Within the sound of my voice
I want her to hear
My special voice
Rainy days can't cloud my mind
From the sunshine she left behind her

As passion's faces turn a sadder blue
But through the tears
My heart keeps searching for you

It was a cold and winter day
When she just turned and walked away
If she would come back
And share the desire
I could hold her again
And we could feel the fire

If she's anywhere
Within the sound of my voice
I want her to hear
My special choice
Rainy days can't cloud my mind
From the sunshine she left behind her''''&''''&''''&''''&''
