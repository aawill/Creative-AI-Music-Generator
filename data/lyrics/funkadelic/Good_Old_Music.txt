Damn
Shake your head
Move that head
Hnh
Shake your head one more

Everybody's gettin' funky
In the days when the funk was gone
I recall not long ago
When the funk was goin' strong

Now they were rocking upside the wall
(To funky music)
Rockin' out in the hall
(To funky music)
Now they were jumpin' up and having a ball
(To funky music)
Music's got them beggin' for more
Give me more
Give me more
Come on
Give me more
Give me more of that
Good old funky music
Yeah
Good old funky music
Yeah

Yes indeed they're groovin'
Yes they are doin' to and fro my dear
Yes indeed they're groovin'
To the music that won't lem 'em go

You know they started somewhere round about midnight
(To funky music)
And they rocked through the night until the daylight
(To funky music)
Music that was groovin' my mother (to funky music)
It's groovin' for my sister and brother

Give me more
Give me more
(Come on, let's sing it together)
Give me more
Give me more of that
Good old funky music
Yeah
Good old funky music
Yeah

That old music that was good for my mother
(To funky music)
It's groovin' for my sister and brother
Give me more
Give me more
Give me more
Give me more of that
Good old funky music
Yeah
Good old funky music
Yeah''''''''''''''''''
