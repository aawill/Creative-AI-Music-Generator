Now I'm a tom cat and you're the pussycat
And I'm just sittin' here, licking my paw
Now I'm the tom cat and you're my little old pussycat
Why don't you scratch me on my back with your claw?

Hey fellas!
Your eyes may shine, your teeth may grit
But none of my kitty-cat you're going to get
Put your foot on the rock
Good god!

I don't know, but I've been told
That dogs are man's best friend
Wild and warm is my baby's love
My kitten is where it's at

And I call my baby pussycat
I spell it p-u-s-s-y c-a-t (oww)
Said I call my baby pussycat
I spell it p-u-s-s-y c-a-t

Ininvited into my brain her body creeps at will
Making love unto my thoughts 
That my purple mind can feel
Pussycat, pussycat is her name
I'll tell you no lie
Pussycat, pussycat is her name
Ask me again and I'll tell you the same

And I call my baby pussycat
I spell it p-u-s-s-y c-a-t (hey)
Said I call my baby pussycat
I spell it p-u-s-s-y c-a-t

Whoa-ha-hey 
Whoa-ha-ha (good god)
Whoa-ha-hey 
Whoa-ha-ha 
 (x2)

And I call my baby pussycat
I spell it p-u-s-s-y c-a-t (waaa-hey)
Said I call my baby pussycat
I spell it p-u-s-s-y c-a-t''''''''''''''''''
