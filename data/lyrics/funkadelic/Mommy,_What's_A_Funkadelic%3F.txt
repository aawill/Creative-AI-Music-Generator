If you will suck my soul
I will lick your funky emotions

Hey baby, hey
Had a dream last night
Man, it was strange
Tasted so good
It was some good stuff

Do it again
Yeah
Hey baby
What's your thang?
What say we touch each other?
Mess around and get our thing goin' on
Yeah, ha, ha, ha!
Ooh ooh
Whoa!
Yeah

By the way, my name is Funk
I am not of your world
Hold still, baby, I won't do you no harm
I think I'll be good to you
Fly on
MmHmmhehhehheheh
Whoa
Oh it's so good

Like I said, I won't do you no harm
I am Funkadelic
Dedicated to the feeling of good
And baby, I'm good at being good
Let me play with your emotions
For nothing is good unless you play with it
Uh
Yeah
Fly on
Fly on baby

So... nasty!
I didn't make the rules
I follow them
And what's so nasty about funky music?
Hehe, feels good to me!
Lord!

Ba-ba ba ba ba
Ba-ba ba ba ba
Ba-ba ba ba bomp bomp buh buh buh buh bah!
Ba-ba ba ba bomp bomp buh buh buh buh bah!
Ba-ba ba ba bomp bomp buh buh buh buh bah!
Ba-ba ba ba bomp bomp buh buh buh buh bah!

Girl!
Whoa! Yeah!
Wait a minute
Do you feel that?
Lord
Lord, baby
Fly on
Fly on baby
Ssssssssh

Let me kiss your mind
Hahha
Let me slide a yard of tongue down your throat
There's nothing wrong with that
Merely a kiss
Why is everyone afraid to say:
Kiss me baby! (make it?)
Whoa, yeah
Kiss me baby!

Kiss me
I like it like that
I like it like that
Owww!
Play with it, baby
Play with it
Play with your emotions
Go ahead, brother

Release all of those feelings
Ooh, ooh
We don't need no words
Just feelings
Do it again brother
Oh!
One more time
Oh!
Yeah
Oh!

I recall when I left a little town in North Carolina
I tried to escape this music
I said it was for the old country folks
I went to New York
Got slick
Got my hair made, hehheheheh
I was cool, heh heh
I was cool
But I had no groove, hehheheh
No groove, no groove, no groove, no groove
I had no groove
But here it comes!
But now, fly on baby
Here it comes
'Cause I got it
Fly on baby
You got it
Dig
Oh
Dig
Dig
Dig
Dig
Dig
Dig
Dig, baby

You got it
You got it now
You got it
Fly on
Fly on sisters
Play on brothers

Ba-ba ba ba ba
Ba-ba ba ba ba
Ba-ba ba ba bomp bomp buh buh buh buh bah
Ba-ba ba ba ba
Ba-ba ba ba ba
Ba-ba ba ba bomp bomp buh buh buh buh bah

Can you feel that baby
It's called Funkadelic music
It will blow your funky mind
Yeah!'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
