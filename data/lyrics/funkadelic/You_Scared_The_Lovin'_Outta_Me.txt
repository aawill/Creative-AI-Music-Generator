You scared me, baby (yeah)
You scared the love right out of me
(x3)

I thought I knew all there is to do
I stuck out my chest and dove into a love
With ego in charge, I charged into what seemed
To be the quickest way into manhood

You scared me, baby
You scared the love right outta me
(x2)
Oh, ha, ha, ha, ha, whoa

"Eat this for me" and from a tiny tree
She plucked a fruit and placed it on her navel
I was no freak, but I was gettin' weak
I took the quickest way into her womanhood

You scared me, baby (yeah)
You scared the love right outta me
(x5)
