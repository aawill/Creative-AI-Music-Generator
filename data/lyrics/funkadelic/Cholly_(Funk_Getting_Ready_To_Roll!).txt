I was strung out on Bach
And Beethoven was my thing
I dug jazz, I dug rock
Anything with a swing
Then I ran into a friend Who told me there was so much more
Find the void that you missed
There is plenty to explore

We want to take you, Cholly, when we go
(You wanna take me?)

We'd like to take you, Cholly, when we roll
(Well, if you'd play me just a little bit more)
But if we play you just a little more
(Maybe I will)
We'd love to take you, Cholly, when we go

You know right about that time I started
To analyze what they were trying to tell
Me, they said: "Come on, Cholly, we want to
Take you somewhere"
I didn't know where
They was trying to take me, next thing I
Know they were saying something like this:
Funk, gettin' ready to go-
Funk gettin' ready to roll (what?)
Funk, gettin' ready to go-
Funk gettin' ready to roll
(What in the world are they talking about?)
Funk gettin' ready to roll-gettin' ready to go?
No, they can't do that

Funk gettin' ready to go
Funk gettin' ready to roll-see I've Bach-I love Beethoven
Funk gettin' ready to go
Funk gettin' ready to roll

I would dance, I would sing
I could get lost in my dreams
I would fly, but never too high
'Cause my funk deserted me
Now that the door is open wide
And all my funk just can't hide
With the syndrome left behind
No, my funk just can't hide

We like to take you, Cholly, when we go
We like to take you, Cholly, when we roll
(They promise they would play one more time)
But if we play you just a little bit more
We'd like to take you, Cholly, etc

You know
It was in my hands
It was in my feet
I got it all over me
Yes, I did, I got it all over me
Got to go, got to go
Got to go with the funk

Get ready

I would waltz, I would sing
I would get lost in my dreams
I would fly but never too high
'Cause the funk deserted me
Now that the door is open wide
And my funk I can't hide
(I must go with the funk)''''''''''''''''
