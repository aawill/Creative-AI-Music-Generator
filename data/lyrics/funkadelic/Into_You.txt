Into you now
Into you now
Into you now
Into you, my people

I can't get into the neutron bomb
I can't get into something that will do me some harm
I can't get into a drug addict principle
I can't get into something that would close the door

If it's right
It's all right for you now
If it's right
It's all right for me now, yo-ho
Any night you'll be uptight until you find
That the wrong and the right are within your mind

Into you now
Into you now
Into you now
Into you now
Into you, my people

Into you now
Imagine me
Into you now
Into you
Into you now
My heart
Into you, my people

I can't get into the poisoned land
I can't get into something I don't understand
I can't into a bad romance
I can't get into a love that ends in a chance

If it's right
It's all right with you now
If it's right
It's all right for me now, yo-ho
Any night you'll be uptight until you find
That the wrong and the right are within your mind

If it's right
It's all right with you now
If it's right
It's all right for me now, yo-ho
Any night you'll be uptight until you find
That the wrong and the right are within your mind

Into you now
Into you now
Into you now
Into you, my people
And you into me''''''''''''''''
