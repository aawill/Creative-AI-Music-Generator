(--Chanted, repeated after each line--)

The world is a toll-free toilet
Our mouths neurological assholes
And psychologically speaking
We're in a state of mental diarrhoea
Talking shit a mile a minute
Or in a state of constipated notions
Can't think of nothin' but shit
And in this world of stinkin' futures,
Shitty memories,
Constipated 19 now-now's
Emerges from the hiney of your head
The Doo-Doo Chasers
The Promentalshitbackwashpsychosisenemasquad
The prune juice of the mind
The Doo-Doo Chasers
Friends of roto-rooter
Bringing you music to get your shit together by
The band in the tidy bowl of your brain
(What was that long word again? Promental-?)
Promentalshitbackwashpsychosisenemasquad

A musical bowel movement
Designed to rid you of moral diarrhoea
Social bullshit
Crazy doo-doo
Mental poops

They call us the unflushables

One swipe a clean wipe

(Go flush it, fellas!)

And what's cause of all of this shit?
What is the source of food for thought?
Ego-munchies
Images (?) doggie bags
A my burger with I sauce on it
A me burger with I sauce on it
A myself sandwich
A personal burger
A Hamburger
And a glass of constricted cola
Out to lunch with lunch meat
The fear of being eaten by a sandwich
The Promentalshitbackwashpsychosisenemasquad
The Doo-Doo Chasers
Friends of roto-rooter
Music to clean your shit by (?)

Low calorie logic
Muscle brains
Skinny brains

Count the calories of your thoughts

Funk, Confucius says
Like Chinese laxatives
Sweet and sour bowel movements

And in this world of stinky memories
Spanking memories
Shitty futures
19 now now's-constipated-like
Where is the Doo-Doo Chaser?
The prune juice of the mind
The band in the tidy bowl of your brain
Bringing you music to put your shit together by

Funk, the pee preparation
The prune juice of the mind
A mental musical bowel movement
Groovalax
One swipe a clean wipe

And with no extra charge
A psychological turd remover
A neurological enema
Holy Shit
(Let me try one-crap)
Corpolites (?)
Prehistoric doo doo
Helping you get your shit together

*Backstage at a Funkadelic rehearsal
We bring you the doo doo chasers*
(Which one is George Clinton?)
Out to lunch with lunch meat, once again
The fear of being eaten by a sandwich
Lunchville
Where lunch is a nice time of day at least twice a week
