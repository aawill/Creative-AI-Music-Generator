It's been a long time comin', now I'm into somethin' that's got me feelin' good
This feelin' inside me is startin' to guide me
This change is gonna do me good
Oh if you're feelin' like I'm feelin' take an inner view
Deep down inside you'll find a love needed for me and you
People, my skies are blue no more are they gray
I've found a light that shines so bright, it shows me a better way
It will be alright if you could see it too
Would it be alright to share our change with you
We are children of understanding, we are people who like to fly
Come join our safari and to the old ways you can say goodbye

You'll like it too
You and you and you and you
And you'll like it too
You and you and you and you
(x2)

We're groovin' now, the speed of sound is movin' through our brain
But when it stops the pressure drops but the feelin' still remains
People sleepin', always weepin', none of our old ways we plan on keepin'
It'll be alright, if you could see it too
Would it be alright to share our change with you
We are groovers of funk festation
We are minds that like to fly
Prime movers of funk elation
A sensation that keeps you high

You'll like it too
You and you and you and you
And you'll like it too
You and you and you and you
(x2)

You gonna like it
You'll like it too
You and you and you and you
You gonna like it, yeah
And you'll like it too
You and you and you and you
You gonna be crazy about it
You'll like it too
You and you and you and you
Ain't no doubt about it
And you'll like it too
You and you and you and you
You gonna like it

Still groovin' now, the speed of sound is movin' through our veins
And when it stops and the pressure drops but the feelin' still remains
People sleepin', always weepin', none of our old ways we plan on keepin'

It will be alright if you could see it too
Would it be alright to share our change with you
(x2)

To share our change with you'''''&''''''&''''''&'''&'''&''''
