You got to wake up!
Live in the presence of your future
Wake up!
See what we're doing in our sleep
You've got to wake up!
Live in the presence of your future
Wake up
Learn from the mistakes of the past

From time to time we come alive
But not for very long
See the shape the world is in
And wonder what went wrong
Never dreaming not for a second
Sleeping is the cause
We make solutions in our sleep
It's dangerous for us all

You got to wake up!
Live in the presence of your future
Wake up!
See what we're doing in our sleep
You've got to wake up!
Live in the presence of your future
Wake up
Learn from the mistakes of the past

In our sleep we live it up
Just to wake up find we're dead
Change our hair and hairstyles too
But have the same empty heads
Brothers and sisters I'm telling you
Now's all the time for us
This is what we've got to do
And we can have the lives we'd love?

You've got to wake up
You've got to wake up
Oh, wake up (you got to doo doo de doo doo doo)
You've got to wake up
(They don't have to man!)
Oh, wake up
You've got to wake up
Oh, wake up
You've got to wake up

You got to wake up!
Live in the presence of your future
Wake up!
See what we're doing in our sleep
You've got to wake up!
Live in the presence of your future
Wake up!
Learn from the mistakes of the past

In our sleep, we change our wife
We change our suit of clothes
We change our church, we change our god
But have the same funky soul

Never dreaming, not for a second
Sleeping is the cause
We make solutions in our sleep
And it's dangerous for us all

Oh, wake up
You've got to wake up
(Repeat with scat until end)''''''''''''''''''
