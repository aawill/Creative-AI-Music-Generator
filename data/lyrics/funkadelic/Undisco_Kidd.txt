She's bad! The girl is bad!
Bad! The lady is bad!

Now the kid was kick-back, lining the cut
Eatin' some fish and chips
And this freaky little groupie
From the funky side of town
Begin to give him some lip
She was babblin' about how bad, ah
She could do the bump
The kid said on the real side of things
Bertha, you got too much rump to bump!

Move, your sexy body
Baby, let me see you move it all across the floor
Move, your sexy body
Every time you wiggle you hear the men holler for more

The girl is bad!

I'm on the ten most wanted list
I've got it dead in the groove
My face is on every wanted poster in town
For the way I move (move)
I'm public enemy #1 (your sexy body)
To the undisco scene
And, kid, if you don't get up your you-know-what and dance with me
(Everytime you wiggle you hear the mean holler for more)
I'm gonna be forced to get mean

The kid was cool
He was no fool
He said, "Get the funk off case"
Without missing a beat
Snatchin' him to his feet
She bumped him all in the face

Now the kid was teasin'
He was definitely uncool
Trying to get some hat?
(Move your sexy body)
And she bumped him right back
(Baby let me see you move it all across the floor)

Move, your sexy body
Baby, let me see you move it on the disco floor
Move, your sexy body
Move your body
Close to mine

Bad! The girl is bad!
Bad! Bad!
Bad! The lady is bad!
Bad! She's bad!

He scream, he shout (move your sexy body)
She turned that sucker out
He scream, he shout (move your sexy body)
She turned that sucker out
Extra, extra, read all about it (move your body)
We got a brand new thang
Makin' headline news (close to mine)
Extra, extra, read all about it
We got a brand new thang
Makin' headline news

Move your sexy body
Baby, let me see you move it all across the floor
Glide, your slender body
Every time you wiggle, make the men holler for more
Bad! The girl is bad
Real bad! She's bad!
Bad! Bad! Bad! Bad!

He scream, he shout
She turned that mother out
He scream, he shout
She turned that sucker out
He scream, he shout (move your sexy body)
She turned that sucker out
He scream, he shout
She turned that sucker out (close to mine)
He scream, he shout (move your sexy body)
She turned that sucker out
Bad! The girl is bad!
Bad! She's bad!
Bad! She's bad!
Bad! (every time she wiggle, she make the kid holler for more) Bad!
Move your sexy body
Baby, let me see you move it all across the floor
Glide your slender body
Baby, when you move, you make the men holler for more
Glide your slender body
Every time you wiggle, you make the men giggle for more
She's bad, the girl is bad!
Every time she wiggle, she make the kid holler for more
Glide your sexy body
Baby let me see you dancing on the disco floor

Ah-ah-yeah
Every time she wiggle, she make the kid holler for more
