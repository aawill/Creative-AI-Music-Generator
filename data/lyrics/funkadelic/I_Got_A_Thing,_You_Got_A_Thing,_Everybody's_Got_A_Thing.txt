I got a thang
You got a thang
Everybody's got a thang
When we get together
Doin' our thing
In order to help each other
In order to help your brother

I got a thang
You got a thang
Everybody's got a thang
When we get together
Doin' our thing
In order to help each other
In order to help your brother

You don't drink what I drink
You don't smoke what I smoke
You don't think like I think
You don't joke like I joke

I got a thang
You got a thang
Everybody's got a thang
When we get together
Doin' our thing
In order to help each other
In order to help your brother'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
