Connections and disconnections
We make our bodies move in all directions
Connections and disconnections
We groove, we move our limbs section by section

I come completely apart at the thought of having fun
But that secret substance funk keeps us together
It's the bomb
We're from tomorrow spending your borrowed time
Clonin' none and havin' fun energizing on the one
Transported by flotilla to your galaxy to groove
Armed with lazers' rhythms to make those booties move
And we are conquerors of getting down if you can get to that
Parliaposafunkalotton, hey what's that

Connections and disconnections
We make our bodies move in all directions
Connections and disconnections
We groove, we move our limbs section by section

The earhole is our workshop, your minds are our stages
We're givin' you the gift of funk to pass on through the ages
We're flotating funklords travelling far and near
To feel the force of lifting off, you get off first right here

Connections and disconnections
We make our bodies move in all directions
Connections and disconnections
We groove, we move our limbs section by section

Give it to Ben, gone Ben, get it Ben, hit it
Gone get it
Gone get it Ben, get it don't quit it
(x2)

Say brother

When your mouth stop runnin' and your lips get sore
And the fun in your funky ain't funky no more boy,
Somethin's wrong with ya
(x9)

Connections and disconnections
We make our bodies move in all directions
Sectioned and blendin', stroke to note transcendin'
Grab hold to a good riff, good vibes we don't mind sendin'
There's a method to this spacin'
Ain't no rattin' and a racin'
Connectin' and disconnectin' everybody

Connections and disconnections
We make our bodies move in all directions
Connections and disconnections
We groove, we move our limbs section by section

Now, let me say this about that
It's not what you can do for the funk
It's what the funk can do for you''''&''''&''''&''''&''
