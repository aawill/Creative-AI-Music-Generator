Just because it's said
That a man is not
Supposed to cry

Just because we conceal what we feel
When it hurts deep down inside

Why don't they realize
That it's just a disguise
To hide the way that we feel?
We hurt too
This is true

Why don't they see through this
Pretending of happiness?
They are really some tears

And when they say goodbye
We will drown on the inside
By those same little tears

And know this is true
That the man can make her blue
He made me and he made you

This is true
We hurt too
We hurt too

There is no difference
We're just like you
It's the same laughing and crying
Loving and dying that we do
So remember every day
As you pass along life's way
What I said to you
That because you see no tears
It's not happiness I feel
When you say we're through

Sugar it's hard that you find
With my faith in you denied
That he really loves you

Yes it's true
We hurt too''''''''''''''''''
