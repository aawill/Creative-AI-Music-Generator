This old heart
Couldn't stand the strain
This old heart
Couldn't stand the pain

I've got the strangest feeling you've grown tired of me
Something that was ours has gone and made you unhappy
What's wrong, baby?

Complainin' by the day, I can feel the change
I've been working down south for?
And you're convinced that I'm to blame
What's wrong, baby?

'Cause this old heart is not in shape
This old heart couldn't stand the strain
This old man is going insane
You're taking your love away

I'm losing you, I don't know why
Tell me what can I do
I don't want to say anything
Just to hold on to you
Dig it, baby

Lover's words are so unfair
To make everybody kiss
I don't know but I've been told
Make ? this
Dig it, baby

'Cause this old heart is not in shape, oh no
This old heart couldn't stand the strain
This old man is going insane

Don't do it (don't!)
Don't do it (don't!)
Don't take your love away (mama don't take it away!)
(x4)

Heeey!
(x2)

(Everybody say it, come on!)
Don't do it (don't!)
Don't do it (don't!)
Don't take your love away (mama don't take it away!)
(x5)
Don't do it (please don't take it away)
Don't do it (well!)
Don't take your love away'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
