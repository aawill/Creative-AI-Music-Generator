I'm not conceited, by no means, yeah
I just know what I'm capable of
But if you're looking for some love
I'm qualified to satisfy

Now if you're man
Ain't where it's at, yeah
Now if he is as cold as that, yeah
Just tell the square
To get his hat
I'm qualified to satisfy
Yeeeeaaaaoooooo''''''''''''''''''
