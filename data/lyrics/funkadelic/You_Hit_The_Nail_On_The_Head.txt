You hit the nail on the head

You hit the nail on the head

Just because you win the fight
Don't make you right
Just because you give
Don't make you good

Just because you win the fight
Don't make you right
Just because you give
Don't make you good

Just because you win the fight
Don't make you right
Just because you give
Don't make you good

Just because you win the fight
Don't make you right
Just because you give
Don't make you good

Just because you win the fight
Don't make you right
Just because you give
Don't make you good

Just because you win the fight
Don't make you right
Just because you give
Don't make you good

Just because you win the fight
Don't make you right
Just because you give
Don't make you good

Just because you win the fight
Don't make you right
Just because you give
Don't make you good

Just because you win the fight
Don't make you right
Just because you give
Don't make you good

Ah
Somebody there is leaving
Somebody there is afraid
Somebody there is lying
Somebody said he's dead (?)''''''''''''''''''
