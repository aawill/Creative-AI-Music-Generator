If you got funk, you got style
You're funkin' and you're styling all the while
When you got funk, you got class
You're out on the floor movin' your ass

She ain't conscientious about her talk
Don't give a damn about her walk
She gets to that and that's the funk?
When she does this funk she never stop

I don't claim to be a super freak
She just want to dance to a freaky beat
She don't claim to be a cover girl
Don't claim to be, but give it a whirl

Go 'head, go 'head, go 'head (cover girl)
Go 'head, go 'head, go 'head (super freak)
Go 'head, go 'head, go 'head (she ain't)
Go 'head, go 'head, go 'head

If you got funk, you got style
You're funkin' and you're styling all the while
If you got funk, you got class
You're out on the floor movin' your ass
(x2)

Girl'll give it a whirl
Girl ain't a cover girl
She ain't a super freak
Girl ain't a super freak
She'll give it a whirl
Girl ain't a cover girl
She'll give it a whirl
Girl ain't a cover girl

Ain't a cover girl
She ain't a super freak
Need a freaky beat
She'll give it a whirl
Girl ain't a cover girl
She'll give it a whirl
Girl ain't a cover girl (need a freaky beat)
She'll give it a whirl (ow!)
Girl ain't a cover girl
She'll give it a whirl (she needs a super beat)
Girl ain't a cover girl (she needs a super... beat)
She'll give it a whirl
Girl ain't a cover girl
She'll give it a whirl
Girl ain't a cover girl''''''''''''''''
