Everything is there when you're living in the city
Everything is there in a war
Everything is there in love
Everything is there on stage

Let's take it to the people
Ah, let's take it to the people (let's take it to the stage!)
Ah, let's take it to the stage
Ah, let's take it on my music
Let's take it on my music
Hey baby, that's what I like

Everything is there when you're trying to get over
Everything is there when you're trying to cop
Everything is there if you're sexy
Everything is there on stage

Let's take it to the people
Ah, let's take it to the people (let's take it to the stage!)
Ah, let's take it to the stage
Ah, let's take it on my music
Let's take it on my music 
Hey baby, that's what I like'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
