Till the day my suspicions are gone
I won't have to hear my friends try and tell me I'm wrong
Till the day my suspicions are gone
I won't have to hear my friends try and tell me I'm wrong

I'm never gonna tell it
I'm never gonna tell it
I'm never gonna say that you're doing me wrong
Or admit that my trust in you is gone
You'll never find out we're not getting along
I'm never gonna tell it
Oh no
No one's ever gonna know it
'Cause I'm never gonna show it
Until the day my suspicions are gone
I won't have to hear my friends try and tell me I'm wrong
They'll always think that we are getting along
I'm never gonna tell it
Oh no

No one's ever gonna see that you put me down girl
You been a runaround girl
A playgirl
A hip-hooray girl
But there's gonna be a change in your foolish ways girl
This dog will have his day oh boy girl
It'll be my victory

I'm never gonna tell it
I'm never gonna tell it
I'm never gonna say that you're doing me wrong
Or admit that my trust in you is gone
They'll never find out we're not getting along
I'm never gonna tell it

No one's ever gonna know it
'Cause I'm never gonna show it
Until the day my suspicions are gone
I won't have to hear my friends try and tell me I'm wrong
They'll always think that we are getting along
I'm never gonna tell it
Oh no

No one's ever gonna say that you put me down girl
You been a runaround girl
A playgirl
A hip-hooray girl
But there's gonna be a change in your foolish ways girl
This dog will have his day oh boy girl
It'll be my victory

I'm never gonna tell it
Said I ain't gonna speak on it
Until the day my suspicions are gone
I won't have to hear my friends try and tell me I'm wrong
Until the day my suspicions are gone
I won't have to hear my friends try and tell me I'm wrong

I'm not gonna speak on it
Until the day my suspicions are gone
I won't have to hear my friends try and tell me I'm wrong
Until the day my suspicions are gone
I won't have to hear my friends try and tell me I'm wrong
Until the day my suspicions are gone
