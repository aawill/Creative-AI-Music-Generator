It was no potion, that notion that led to my devotion
To movin' movin', and if the anti-grooves just cannot soothe
Your desperate funkish urge for groovin' and if your funk is ailin' still
There's no cure, there ain't no pills
He's the one that can do it for ya
One and one and one is three
Dr. Funk is all you need, he's the one that can heal it for ya
If you lived a funkless life
Groovin' less, feelin' un-nice, he's the one that can change it for ya
If you want some quick reaction
Guarantees you satisfaction, you'll groove the world
Oh oh oh, he's got your prescription, he's the doctor
Calling the doctor
Don't use no funny pills, 'cause he's the doctor
Calling the doctor
Through funk is how he heals, he's the doctor
Calling the doctor
Duh duh duhduh duh, call the doctor
If you lived a funkless life
Groovin' less, feelin' un-nice, he's the one that can change it for ya
If you want some acleyfaction
Pull your funk up out of traction
You'll groove the world
Oh oh oh, he's got your prescription, he's the doctor
Calling the doctor
Don't use no funny pills, 'cause he's the doctor
Calling the doctor
Through funk is how he heals, he's the doctor
Calling the doctor
Duh duh duhduh duh, call the doctor
You've got to call, call the doctor (x3)
Yes, you've got to call, call the doctor

Ah, call the funky doctor when you're down on your side
Call the doctor
And prepare your anatomy for takin' a ride
He's the one that can do it for ya
Call the doctor
Woo, when you need a cure and it's got to be real
Call the doctor
He's the P in prescriptions with the thrill of a pill
He's the one that can do it for ya
Call the doctor, woo
(x3)

He's the doctor, he will take care all your ills
Call the doctor
(x3)''''&''''&''''&''''&''
