Father, open our eyes, that we
May see, to follow thee. Oh lord
Grant us, thy lovin' peace, and let
All dissension cease. Let our fait,
Each day increase,
And Master - Lord please-
Open our eyes, open our eyes-

He has given us, hills and mountains, he
Has given us, level places.
He has given us food and clothing,
Given us shelter from the storm and the rain-
And all that he provided,
Kept us shelter from the storm and the rain-

Grant us thy lovin' peace,
And let all dissension cease,
Let our faith each day increase,
And Master - Lord please
Open our eyes, open our eyes''''''''''''''''
