Show me a sign that I love you 
Blow me a mind as you always do 
Remind me to tell you that I've come to 
Believe in the beauty, the power of you 
Woman, dissolve into the sea 
The body of water is calling me 
The god of my daughter is always free 
There's nothing to solve and you're solving me 

Ooh, I'm in your company 
Ooh, body that's calling me 
Ooh, I'm in your company 

Throw me a line I could use one 
I special-design me 'cause I'm your son 
Two thousand below where I feel my love 
The body of water where I come from 

I'm dreaming, got a reason to steal 
Fire from the other side out there 
Formations flow like screams 

I'm made with a life to spare 
Get the jizz, Mister sism? got a rhythm 
Technology of a prayer 
Scientist to the prism of faith 
And hope so I am there 

Baby I'm old, can you come here? 
The science of love is becoming clear 
Invisible love with the color still 
I need to a place in the atmosphere 
And I may believe...''''''''''''''''
