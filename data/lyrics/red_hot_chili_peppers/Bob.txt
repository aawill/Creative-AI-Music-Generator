Well, my friend Bob's in jail today
His girlfriend is too
For stealing change for gasoline

Nothing to do but rue
Destroy the bruise (???)
'Cause there will never be another one just like you, no
Bob...

I met him on the boulevard, Hollywood and Vine
He said, "You're gonna be a superstar"
I said, "That's fine, sublime"
He loved my crime

But there will never be another one just like you, no
Bob
I never see you
I never see you
I never see you

**Something something** all through the night
Blackest flag at dawn
A lust for life that kills itself before it gets too strong, that's wrong
Please be lifelong

'Cause there will never be another one just like you, no
Bob...
I never see you
I never see you
I never see you

Killing yourself, that would be an awesome oath
This song is so far away (???)
Remember the home and how they left us alone (???)
Remember our friendship

Stealing everything in the store
You know I want you to stay
Remember the home and how they left us alone (???)
Friends fade away...

Well, my friend Bob's insane today
I know I am too
The mental patients laugh and cry

Nothing to do but rue
Destroy the bruise (???)
'Cause there will never be another one just like you, no
Bob...''''''''''''''''
