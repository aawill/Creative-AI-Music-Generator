Walking around
All over town
Workin' it out
When you want to

Soldiering my style and smiling
Turn it into whatever I choose

Take me now to the water

Don't be late I hear it's gonna be so very great and
Out the door I'm walkin' like a runaway
All the reasons that I count of you can't haul away and
More and more I'm walkin' like a runaway

Kick it around
Stare at the ground
Breakin' it down
When you want to

Soldiering my desert shows on
Dance around, do whatever I want to

Take me now it's the water

Don't be late I hear it's gonna be so very great and
Out the door I'm walkin' like a runaway
All the reasons that I count of you can't haul away and
More and more I'm walkin' like a runaway

I think I know everything your gonna say *eyyooooh*
I think you know why I wanna runaway

Don't be late I hear it's gonna be so very great and
Out the door I'm walkin' like a runaway
All the reasons that I count of you can't haul away and
More and more I'm walkin' like a runaway

All the reasons that I count of you can't haul away and
More and more I'm walkin' like a runaway
More and more I'm walkin' like a runaway
Out the door I'm walkin' like a runaway''''''''''''''''''
