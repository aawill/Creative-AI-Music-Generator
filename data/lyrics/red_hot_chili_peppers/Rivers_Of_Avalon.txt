Deep inside these sleeping shallows
Far away where no one goes now
Take my place in Gordon Spacer
TV star that no one knows now
Deep deep mystery is talking to me
She's a giver of constant animation
All around and ready to make a new formation
You're the reason I'm in this world

I don't believe in everything I see
Rivers of Avalon
Your supernatural energy
Part of my scenery
What I belong to is your ecstacy
Rivers of Avalon
Your faith gone wavering is key

The clone of my own lonliness
Has got to be what am I known to
Little darlin' in your starlin
Loving ways that I've succumbed to
Deep deep mystery is talking to me
She's a giver of constant adulation
All around and ready to make a new formation
You're the reason I'm in this world

I don't believe in everything I see
Rivers of Avalon
Your supernatural energy
Part of my scenery
What I belong to is your ecstacy
Rivers of Avalon
Your faith gone wavering is key
Wadda you see in me?

Deep deep mystery is talking to me
She's a giver of constant animation
All around and ready to make a new formation
Your the reason I'm in this world


I don't believe in everything I see
Rivers of Avalon
Your supernatural energy
Part of my scenery
What I belong to is your ecstacy
Rivers of Avalon
Your faith gone wavering is key

I don't believe in everything I see
Rivers of Avalon
Your supernatural energy
All out in me''''''''''''''''
