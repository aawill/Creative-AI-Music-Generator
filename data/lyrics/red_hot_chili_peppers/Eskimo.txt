In the name of it's for you I
Bought it all and it's all untrue I
Know, I'm a little slow
Desperate and it shows

In the name of spending street
Burning bush and a busted knee you
Stole, all the rain and snow

Who will be my Eskimo
It's what I wanna know
It's time to undergo
Somewhere in Mexico
I'm making room for you
A simple point of view
Someone too deeper to

Aw
Searching for an Eskimo
Searching and I wanna know, someone, like you
What did they say
Desperate and I gotta go
Searching for an Eskimo, someone, like you

In the name of Jesus Christ I
Sold my son and I named my price I
Sold, just a little love

Who will be my Eskimo
That's what I wanna know
Before I undergo
Somewhere in Mexico
I'm making room for you
A simple point of view
Someone too deeper to

Ooh aw
Searching for an Eskimo
Searching and I wanna know, someone, like you
Hey, hey, hey
Desperate and I gotta go
Searching for an Eskimo, someone, like you

In the name of Oscar Wilde I
Saw the mess and I saw he smiled I
Go, toe to toe in the whole, world to find an Eskimo''''''''''''''''
