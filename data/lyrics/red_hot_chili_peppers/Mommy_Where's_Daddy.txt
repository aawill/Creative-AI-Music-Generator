Right here, girl...
Sweet thing, you look so sad
Cheer up, don't you know your dad is bad
Give daddy a kiss, girl

There ain't no problem I can't face
Your daddy's got a bigger pair of tricks
Give daddy a kiss, girl
Oh, dad

Come on, sit on your daddy's lap 'cause
I'm the one who pats your back
Give daddy a kiss, girl
Oh, dad

Lemme see now where to begin
Lemme start by tuckin' you in
Give daddy a kiss, girl
Oh, dad

Mummy, where's daddy?'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
