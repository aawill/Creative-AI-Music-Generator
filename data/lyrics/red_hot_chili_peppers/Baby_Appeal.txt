On the city streets, I got the tunes in my box
I play the Chili Peppers so the public can rock
Excuse me mister, won't you hear my thoughts?
I play in a band, yeah, we're called the Red Hots
While I'm away, boy, I'm afraid not
I've got no time to think and talk
But his baby rocked out on the spot
She was a shakin' and a kickin', that itty bitty tot
Her pop said no, but she just couldn't stop
The kid had a case of toddler rock

But here's a funky fact that I know is real,
The Red Hots have baby appeal
They dig a funky spiel, they'll make some spiel
I say the Peppers have baby appeal
The funk mobile is the one we wheel
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal
We serve those tots in the funk mobile
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal

We stop the fire, we quench the heat
We groove the buttocks walking out in the street
'Cause that's when in the store when who do we meet?
On a hop skip jump up a baby beat
She was a shakin' and a kickin' those itty bitty feet
The next thing you know was she got out of her bleat
Five thousand babies walkin' out in the street
Well, that's a serious sight for me and golly gee whiz!
I just can't tell ya how much we did
Rockin' right out for those itty bitty girls, right out

But here's a funky fact that I know is real,
The Red Hots have baby appeal
They dig a funky spiel, that makes some spiel
I say the Peppers have baby appeal
The funk mobile is the one we wheel
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal
We serve those tots in the funk mobile
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal, so get down!

Got the tunes in my box...
Baby appeal...
Rock out!...
Play the chili, play the chili, play the chili...
Yes, we're called the Red... Hots...
