Here she comes in a suit and tie
Shepherd's bush and a leopard's pie
She's marching to the funky beat
Of James Brown and his dancing feet

Gonna set your fish on fire
Pistol-whipping of desire
So please do not resist your fate
I'll pick you up, yes it's a date

How could I forget to mention
The bicycle is a good invention
Sitting there in a silent movie
Beside the only girl who really ever knew me

Happy days but sadder face
And heaven knows I'm on the case

How could I forget to mention the bicycle?

Somebody told the world
The beauty of your verse
My girl I heard it first
The beauty of your verse

A sticky finger and a wicked taste
Got a lot of love and a lyrical case
Be sure to write it in your book
I promise not to look

I wanna smell your sunny face
Funny place but it's never awaste
I'd hop this fence to make amends
I hope this movie never ends

How could I forget to mention
The bicycle is a good invention
Make it up and making you my business
A funny buttercup gotta live for forgiveness

Happy days but sadder face
And heaven knows I'm on the case

How could I forget to mention the bicycle?

Somebody told the world
The beauty of your verse
My girl I heard it first
The beauty of your verse

Somebody told the world
The beauty of your verse
My girl I heard it first
The beauty of your verse''''''''''''''''''
