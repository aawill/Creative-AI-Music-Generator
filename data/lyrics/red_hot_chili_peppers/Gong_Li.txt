I don't believe it's true
Things that you're going through

Some people say you hate me
I don't believe it's you
Things that you're going through

Some people say to pray for
The one you want to live
The eyes that once were his

The way you want to live
The eyes you want to give

Some people say you played me
I don't care if it's true
I'm waiting here for you

Some people say you made it
I'm not afraid to know
When things are getting low

Some people say you hate me
I don't believe it's true
Things that you're going through

Some people say you hate me
I don't believe it's you
Things that you're going through''''''''''''''''
