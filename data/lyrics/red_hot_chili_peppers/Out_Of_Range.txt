Leaving town to find the flower that I could deserve
Someone moves someone's bound to get their feelings hurt
I'm loving you you're out of range
I wanted you you're out of range

As I walked out into the world I feel a sudden chill
I was bleeding pretty good onto a daffodil
I'm loving you you're out of range
Wanted to you're out of range

I don't want to much more than
Than to be reborn in the morning
Reborn so I can feel ya
The thorns are blooming with ya
I feel ya

I have your number and I dialed it up a hundred times
Barely there your voice is cracking up across state lines
Loving you you're out of range
Wanted you you're out of range

Skies of ecstasy were breaking up
While I do believe the tears of God were
Falling down upon my swollen cheeks
I'm loving you you're out of range
Wanted to you're out of range

I don't want to much more than
Than to be reborn in the morning
Reborn so I can feel ya
The thorns are blooming with ya
I feel ya

I know it hurts when it's taken away
I tell you that I could be living
Today with you or without you ok
Lost by the rain and it's all gonna change

I don't want to much more than
Than to be reborn in the morning
Reborn so I can feel ya
The thorns are blooming with ya
I feel ya

No sir not to much more than
Than to be
Reborn in the morning
Reborn so I can feel ya
The thorns are blooming with ya
I feel ya''''''''''''''''
