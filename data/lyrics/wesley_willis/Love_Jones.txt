This band played at the Double Door
About 500 people were at the show
The rock and roll was awesome
The jam session whooped a pony's ass

The band played it on
The band got down like a Magikist
The crowd roared like a lion
The jam session whooped a horse's ass

The show was over at last
A lot of people met the band
The jam session was awesome
It whipped a pony's ass with a belt
