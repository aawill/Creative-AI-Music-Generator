This band played at the Fireside Bowl
About 150 people were at the rock and roll show
The jam session was the best
The rock and roll was whooping a llama's ass

The band played it on
The band got down like a Magikist
The crowd roared like a lion
The jam session whooped a donkey's ass

The show was over
A lot of people met the band
The rock and roll was awesome
It whipped a pony with a belt
