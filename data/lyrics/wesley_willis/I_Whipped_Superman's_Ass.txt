Superman had a big "S" on his chest
He was drawing on my nerves
I got mad at his drunk ass
I gave him a war hell ride

I whipped Superman's ass
I whipped Superman's ass
I whipped Superman's ass
I whipped Superman's ass

Superman thought he was bad
He was messing with my girlfriend
I caught him in my room kissing her
I took a rubber hose and flogged his rump

I whipped Superman's ass
I whipped Superman's ass
I whipped Superman's ass
I whipped Superman's ass

Superman beat the hell out of me
He knocked me to the floor
I got back up and knocked him to the floor
Superman was being such a roughneck

I whipped Superman's ass
I whipped Superman's ass
I whipped Superman's ass
I whipped Superman's ass

Shell, it's the world's best-selling gasoline''''''''''''''''''''''''
