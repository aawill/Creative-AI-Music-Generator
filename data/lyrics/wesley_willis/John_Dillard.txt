John Dillard was an asshole
He was a real stupid jerk
He attacked me with a box cutter as I exited the 4 Cottage Grove bus
What a stupid-ass motherfucker

At this time, I was cursing back at my mean schizophrenia voices
They were shattering me with profane language
They brought me damaging disharmony in my life
But I was sorry for my bullshit

This incident happened on August 31, 1991 at 10:00 PM on a Saturday night
I rode the 4 Cottage Grove bus talking back to my mean voices
Suddenly, John Dillard mistook my curses as an insult
He whipped out a box cutter on me and followed me to the exit door
He chased after me as I got off the bus, slashing me in the face and back
