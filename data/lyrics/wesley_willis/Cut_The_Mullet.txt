Do something about your long filthy hair
It looks like a rat's nest
Do something about your mullet
Get out the hair clippers, jerk

Cut the mullet!
Cut the mullet!
Cut the mullet!
Cut the mullet!

Get the rat's nest off your head
Get that crazy ass mullet off your skull
Take your ass to the barber shop
Tell the barber that your sick of looking like an asshole

Cut the mullet!
Cut the mullet!
Cut the mullet!
Cut the mullet!

The mullet is the reason that people hate you
They are sick of looking at your nappy wheat sack
Nobody wants to look at you with that mullet on your head
What don't you cut that mullet you numbskull

Cut the mullet!
Cut the mullet!
Cut the mullet!
Cut the mullet!
