This band played at the Oak Theatre
About 800 people were at the show
The jam session was awesome
The rock show whooped a rhino's ass

The band played it on the set
The band got down like a Magikist
The crowd roared like a lion
The jam session whooped a hyena's ass

The rock show was over at last
A lot of people met the rock band
The powerful jam session was awesome
It was a whooping on a mule's ass at the Oak Theatre
