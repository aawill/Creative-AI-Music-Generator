This band played at Wild Cherry
About 200 people were at the rock and roll show
The jam session was terrific
It whipped a horse's ass with a belt

The band played it on
The crowd roared like a lion
The band got down
The jam session whooped a camel's ass

Almost True

The show was over at last
A lot of people met the band
The rock and roll was perfect
It whooped a pony's ass with a belt

Almost True

Rock over London
Rock on, Chicago
Coors Light - it's the right beer now''''''''''''''''
