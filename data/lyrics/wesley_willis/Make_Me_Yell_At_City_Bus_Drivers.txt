Throw an abusive profanity hellride at me
Deprive me of my good time music
Make me feel sorry for myself
Torment me so I will never ride another
Pace joybus route to the suburbs again

Make me yell at city bus drivers
Make me yell at city bus drivers
Make me yell at city bus drivers
Make me yell at city bus drivers

Trap me with tormenting lies that are not true
Call me a fucking bum like I'm a drug trafficker
Call me a fucking jerk like I'm a jewelry store robber
Call me a fucking asshole like I'm a strong armed robber
Make me cause a raucous on every city bus route

Make me yell at city bus drivers
Make me yell at city bus drivers
Make me yell at city bus drivers
Make me yell at city bus drivers

Rough me up so I can act crazy
Make me yell bus drivers
And passengers down on city bus routes
Get me arrested and carted away
To jail by the Chicago police

Make me bust my portable CD player
And dumpster it
Keep me off the Pace joybus bus
By tormenting me with profanity

Make me yell at city bus drivers
Make me yell at city bus drivers
Make me yell at city bus drivers
Make me yell at city bus drivers''''''''''''''''
