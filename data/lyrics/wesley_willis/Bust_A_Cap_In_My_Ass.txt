Reach in your pocket. 
Pull out a .38 caliber revolver.
Aim it at me as I speak. 
Pull the trigger and open fire. 

Bust a cap in my ass
Bust a cap in my ass
Bust a cap in my ass
Bust a cap in my ass

Plug me full of holes in my head. 
Pop my fucking brains out. 
Take my life away from this earth. 
Put me in a coffin. 

Bust a cap in my ass
Bust a cap in my ass
Bust a cap in my ass
Bust a cap in my ass

Blast my stupid, fool ass. 
Fill me full of led. 
Cap my ass and kill me. 
Introduce me to my early grave. 

Bust a cap in my ass
Bust a cap in my ass
Bust a cap in my ass
Bust a cap in my ass
