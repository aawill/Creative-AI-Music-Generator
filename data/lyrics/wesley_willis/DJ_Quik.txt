You are an educated rapper
You can really rap your ass off
You can really knock it out
You can really whoop a zebra's ass

Keep on playing that rap music
Groove it on the jack move
Jam harder like a Magikist
Rap harder like a Magikist

Your rap music is the willpower to my artwork
The music will pick me up
The jam session gets me on the move
Your rap music will take me on a joyride
