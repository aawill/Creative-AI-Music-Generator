Throw a profanity hell ride at me
Shoot all my rhythm music down
Kick me off all Pace bus routes
Keep me stuck in the concrete jungle of Chicago, Illinois

Hell me
Hell me
Hell me
Hell me

Call me an ass in front of my friends
Call me a fucking bum like I live on the streets
Call me a fucking jerk like I'm a music store burglar
Call me a fucking asshole like I'm a terrorist
Make me bust my portable CD player so I can freak out

Hell me
Hell me
Hell me
Hell me

Rough me up so I can weird out
Make me holler at bus drivers and passengers on every CTA bus route
Get me arrested and incarcerated by the Chicago police
Make me stare at a prison wall with one phone call
Make my haunting joy ride plans shatter

Hell me
Hell me
Hell me
Hell me

Rock over London
Rock on, Chicago
Ford - quality is job one''''''''''''''''
