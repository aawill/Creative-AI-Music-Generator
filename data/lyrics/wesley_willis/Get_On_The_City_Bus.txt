Let's ride the city bus
Let's ride it clean on a roadblock
Grab the rapid transit subway
Grab the transit bus down the line

Get on the city bus
Get on the city bus
Get on the city bus
Get on the city bus

The 11 Lincoln bus approached Ashland and Belmont
The city bus was ready to move
The passengers boarded the city bus
When the stoplight turned green, the 11 Lincoln bus took off

Get on the city bus
Get on the city bus
Get on the city bus
Get on the city bus

The 11 Lincoln bus came to my stop
As I got off the bus, I told the male bus driver to shove a broomstick up his ass
He got so tired of my disharmonious bullshit
He threatened to clock a transfer puncher upside my head

Get on the city bus
Get on the city bus
Get on the city bus
Get on the city bus
