It's Saturday, March 9, 1996 at 1:00 PM
Me and my band went to Lawrence, Kansas to play a rock show
It was a two and a half hour trip
At 3:30 PM, me and my band pulled up by the Bottleneck at 737 New Hampshire Street

Dale Meiners yelled at me
Dale Meiners yelled at me
Dale Meiners yelled at me
Dale Meiners yelled at me

At 8:55 PM, me and my band ran a sound check for tonight's rock show
At 9:00 PM, about 400 people crowded the venue
Suddenly, me and my band got onstage and rocked the jam session
It was a great show

Dale Meiners yelled at me
Dale Meiners yelled at me
Dale Meiners yelled at me
Dale Meiners yelled at me

At 1:30 AM on March 10, 1996, I bragged about doing a keyboard solo show when I come back to town
Suddenly, Dale Meiners got mad at me
He yelled at me for dissing my band at 2:00 AM
He gave me a war hell ride by calling me a fucking asshole

Dale Meiners yelled at me
Dale Meiners yelled at me
Dale Meiners yelled at me
Dale Meiners yelled at me
