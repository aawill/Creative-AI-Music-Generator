Once upon a time, I broke into your Lamborghini
I busted out your car windshield with a brick
I stuck my hands in there
I stole your Sony ESP Car Diskman

I broke out your windshield
I broke out your windshield
I broke out your windshield
I broke out your windshield

After I stole your Sony ESP Car Diskman, I went across the street to a gas station
I found me an empty jug and filled it up with gasoline
Suddenly, I ran back to your Lamborghini to set it on fire
I doused your Lamborghini with gasoline and torched it

I broke out your windshield
I broke out your windshield
I broke out your windshield
I broke out your windshield

At 8:45 PM, the fire department and the police came at the scene
The fire department hosed down the burning Lamborghini
15 minutes later, the store car pulled up by my house
The police ejected me and took me to jail
They charged me with vandalism to auto, death from auto, and aggravated arson

I broke out your windshield
I broke out your windshield
I broke out your windshield
I broke out your windshield
