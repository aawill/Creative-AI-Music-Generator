It's Monday, February 5, 1996 at 11:00 AM Eastern Time
Me and my band went to East Orange, New Jersey for a WFMU radio show
It was a 40-minute trip
At 11:55 AM, me and my band pulled up by the college station

I done a poor job
I done a poor job
I done a poor job
I done a poor job

At 1:55 PM, my band ran a ground test with a riff
Fifteen minutes later, I lapsed in the sound booth
I set my rock keyboard up and played two solo songs
It was a false start

I done a poor job
I done a poor job
I done a poor job
I done a poor job

At 2:30 PM, I started rocking hard with my band
I didn't sing a perfect set
I wasted my band members' time
At 3:30 PM, Dale Meiners yelled at me for screwing up the rock set
He gave me a war hell ride as we left the radio station

I done a poor job
I done a poor job
I done a poor job
I done a poor job

Diet Pepsi, uh-huh''''''''''''''''
