Utter a profanity hellride at me. 
Shoot my fun joyride music down. 
Put an end to my Pace joybus adventure. 
Torment me so I will never take Pace bus routes for joyrides again. 

Keep my joyplane from taking off
Keep my joyplane from taking off
Keep my joyplane from taking off
Keep my joyplane from taking off

Torment me with bald face lies that are not true. 
Call me a fucking bum like I sell street drugs. 
Call me a fucking jerk like I'm a maniac assassin. 
Call me a fucking asshole like I'm a hired hit man. 
Make me bust my portable CD player to pieces. 

Keep my joyplane from taking off
Keep my joyplane from taking off
Keep my joyplane from taking off
Keep my joyplane from taking off

Work me up so I can plan a yelling spree. 
Make me holler at passengers on all CTA bus routes. 
Get me arrested and bound for jail by the Chicago police. 
Get me locked up like an animal. 
Keep me from living a harmonious life. 

Keep my joyplane from taking off
Keep my joyplane from taking off
Keep my joyplane from taking off
Keep my joyplane from taking off

Rock over London
Rock on, Chiago
