It's June 20th, 1987 at 2:30 PM.
I went on a harmony joyride on three Pace buses.
The first harmony joyride was the 364 western 159th St bus.
It headed west of Gurnee Park, Illinois and back. 
It was a blast of fun from God.

At 5:00 PM, I rode 352 homestead bus to Chicago Heights, Illinois and back.
I cranked my harmony music up loud on my portable CD player.
I moved my head to the music on the Pace joy bus.
It was a fun joyride.

It was a good time joyride.
I had fun riding the three Pace joy bus routes.
On December 31st 1989, my Pace joy bus adventure ended with demon torment hellrides on CTA bus routes.
