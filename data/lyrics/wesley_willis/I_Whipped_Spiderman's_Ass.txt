Spider-Man thought he was bad
He was screwin' my date up
He was botherin' my girlfriend
He tried to cut her out of seventy dollars

I whipped Spider-Man's ass
I whipped Spider-Man's ass
I whipped Spider-Man's ass
I whipped Spider-Man's ass

Spider-Man messed with my girlfriend
Spider-Man wrapped his arms around her with my bedroom door closed
Suddenly, I opened the bedroom door on Spider-Man's sneaky ass
I caught him kissing my girlfriend and beat him to a pulp with a rubber hose

I whipped Spider-Man's ass
I whipped Spider-Man's ass
I whipped Spider-Man's ass
I whipped Spider-Man's ass

Spider-Man beat the hell out of me
He whirled me and knocked me to the floor
I tore out his world and threw him against the radiator
Spider-Man was being such a stupid jerk

I whipped Spider-Man's ass
I whipped Spider-Man's ass
I whipped Spider-Man's ass
I whipped Spider-Man's ass

Rock over London
Rock on, Chicago
Napa, it's the parts store''''''''''''''''''''''''
