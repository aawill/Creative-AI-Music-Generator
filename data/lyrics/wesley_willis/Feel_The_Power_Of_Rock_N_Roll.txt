Play the rock guitar like a rock star
Rock the casbah like a hurricane
Rock and roll is my music for a joyride
Whip that werewolf with a belt

Feel the power of rock and roll
Feel the power of rock and roll
Feel the power of rock and roll
Feel the power of rock and roll

Play the Fender Strat guitar
Rock it to the Maxwell House
Rock it on the mic, homey!
Rock Saddam Hussein's ass to Russia

Feel the power of rock and roll
Feel the power of rock and roll
Feel the power of rock and roll
Feel the power of rock and roll

Play the rock solo as hard as you can in Woodstock, New York
Make the crowd of 300,000 people roar like a sea monster
Take everyone on a harmony joyride
Whip the hell out of that werewolf's ass

Feel the power of rock and roll
Feel the power of rock and roll
Feel the power of rock and roll
Feel the power of rock and roll
