You are so pretty like a flower
You are the almighty sister
You are so lovable and humble
I love you so in the mix

You are so beautiful like a lily
You are the sweetest girl I know
You are my sweet lover
I love you like Parkay margarine

You are my sweetheart to the end
You are my girl of my dreams
You are my lovely lady for years to come
But as of now, I love you like a milkshake
