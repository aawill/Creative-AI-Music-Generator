This is a song that I'm gonna rap about, and sing about
It's called that "He's Doing Time in Jail"
This is about this guy who slashed me in the face and back as I exited the 4 Cottage Grove bus
This is the dawn of a new era
So let me rap and sing about this song, as I exit the Cottage Grove bus

Once upon a time, on the 4 Cottage Grove bus
I felt like I was on the floor
I was talking to myself
Suddenly, a man in his 30s thought I was talking to him
Suddenly, he started yelling at me, talking vulgar

He's doing time in jail
He's doing time in jail
He's doing time in jail
He's doing time in jail
He's doing time in jail
He's doing time in jail
He's doing time in jail
He's doing time in jail

As he yelled at me vulgarly, I tried to tell him to shut his face
But he refused to do so!
When I was about to get up and get off the bus, that same guy whipped out a box cutter on me
He followed me to the exit door, chasing after me, as I got off the bus
That was at 4358 South Cottage Grove Avenue
He then slashed me in the face, and then in the back

He's doing time in jail
He's doing time in jail
He's doing time in jail
He's doing time in jail
He's doing time in jail
He's doing time in jail
He's doing time in jail
He's doing time in jail

When the ambulance came at the scene, I was rushed to the hospital
The police was there
That same guy who slashed me in the face and back was arrested and taken to jail
He's doing time in jail
He's doing time in jail
He's doing time in jail

He's doing time in jail
He's doing time in jail
He's doing time in jail
He's doing time in jail
He's doing time in jail
He's doing time in jail
He's doing time in jail
He's doing time in jail
He's doing time in jail
He's doing time in jail
He's doing time in jail
He's doing time in jail

He's doing time in jail, Amen!

He's doing time in jail, Amen!

He's doing time in jaaaaaail

Amen!

Amen!'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
