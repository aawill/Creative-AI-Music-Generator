Don't kill people you don't know
Don't shoot them with guns
Don't rob gas stations and banks
Don't rob liquor stores elsewhere

It's against the law
It's against the law
It's against the law
It's against the law

Don't sell illegal drugs
Don't bust people in the head
Don't stick up people for money
Don't ever take things that don't belong to you

It's against the law
It's against the law
It's against the law
It's against the law

Never assault a police officer
Never threaten a security guard
Never kill a probation officer
Keep your ass out of the metal clink

It's against the law
It's against the law
It's against the law
It's against the law

Allstate, you're in good hands''''''''''''''''''''''''
