Rail a filthy vulgarity hell ride at me
Shoot my harmony joyride music down
Turn me away so I can't catch any Pace joy bus routes
Keep me stuck in the pain chamber of Chicago, Illinois

Make sure I'm out screwing up
Make sure I'm out screwing up
Make sure I'm out screwing up
Make sure I'm out screwing up

Torment me with lies in front of my friends
Call me a fucking bum like I'm a con man
Call me a fucking jerk like I'm a rapist
Call me a fucking asshole like I'm an arsonist
Take me on a series of war hell rides with every CTA bus ride

Make sure I'm out screwing up
Make sure I'm out screwing up
Make sure I'm out screwing up
Make sure I'm out screwing up

Rough me up so I can holler like a damn fool
Get me arrested and taken to jail by the Chicago police
Make me bust my portable CD player to smithereens
Kill all my good time music
Turn my Sunday sightseeing bus tour into a nerve-shattering hell ride

Make sure I'm out screwing up
Make sure I'm out screwing up
Make sure I'm out screwing up
Make sure I'm out screwing up

Spirit, it's the next British invasion'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
