Pull out a .38 caliber revolver
Level it at my head
Tree my ass and plunder me of my cash money
Hit me with a gunshot

Dumpster my ass
Dumpster my ass
Dumpster my ass
Dumpster my ass

Plug me full of holes
Pump me full of lead
Gun me down in execution style
Throw my body in a ditch

Dumpster my ass
Dumpster my ass
Dumpster my ass
Dumpster my ass

Introduce me to my grave
Deprive me of my life
Snuff it out of me
Leave me dead in the alley

Dumpster my ass
Dumpster my ass
Dumpster my ass
Dumpster my ass
