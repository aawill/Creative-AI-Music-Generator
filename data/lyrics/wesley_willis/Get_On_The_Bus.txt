Let's ride the city bus
Let's ride it clean on the yellow line
Ride the circuit rapid transit
Ride it on the road to Utopia

Get on the bus
Get on the bus
Get on the bus
Get on the bus

The 22 Clark bus approached Fullerton Parkway
The city bus was ready to move
The passengers boarded the city bus
When the stoplight turned green, the 22 Clark bus took off

Get on the bus
Get on the bus
Get on the bus
Get on the bus

The 22 Clark bus passed me up
I picked up a rock and threw it at the bus
Then I called the bus driver a fucking jerk
I told him to suck a camel's ass and fuck off

Get on the bus
Get on the bus
Get on the bus
Get on the bus

Diet Pepsi, uh-huh''''''''''''''''
