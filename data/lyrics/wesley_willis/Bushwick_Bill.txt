You are a gangster rapper
You are a gangster rap artist
You can really knock it out
You can really whip a camel's ass

Keep on playing that gangster rap music
Groove it on the jack move
Rock it like a magickist
Rock harder like a magickist

Your gangster rap music is the willpower to our artwork
The music will harmonize me
The jam session keeps me on the move
Your gangster rap music will take me on a joyride
