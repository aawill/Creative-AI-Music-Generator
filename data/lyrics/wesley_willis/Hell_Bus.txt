On April 23, 1995 at 1:30 PM, I went on a spooky hell ride on three buses 
It was no fun at all
I didn't hear any rock music
All I heard was profanity riding me on my bus tour by a mean schizophrenia voice

At 2 o'clock PM, I spooked the male bus driver on the 76 Diversey bus
I told him to suck my dick
He was so pissed at me
He told me to get my ass off the bus

Hell bus

At 2:25 PM, I spooked another bus driver on the 22 Clark bus
I raved and ranted
My joyride jam session was struck down
My rock music was yanked away
My Sunday afternoon bus tour was a damaging, spooky hellride

Rock over London
Rock on, Chicago
Subway - it's the place where fresh is the taste''''''''''''''''
