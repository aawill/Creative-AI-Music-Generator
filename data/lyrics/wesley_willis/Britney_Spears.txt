You're so pretty to the max
You're so sweet as domino sugar
You are the pretty lady in me
I love you like a back seat driver

You're so pretty in Jesus name
You're so hot in Jesus Christ
You're the pretty woman in the holy ghost
I love you like a taxi driver

You're the pretty lady to the end
You're the pretty lady to eternity as I speak
You're my honeylovin for evermore
You're my honeylovin for the next 64 years
