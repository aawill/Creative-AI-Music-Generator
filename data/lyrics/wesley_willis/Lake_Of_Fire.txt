You are a sinner
You have God's word on it
You will die and be cast into the lake of fire because of your sin

Lake of fire
Lake of fire
Lake of fire
Lake of fire

You cannot save or help save yourself
Not of works, unless any man should boast
You have God's word on it

Lake of fire
Lake of fire
Lake of fire
Lake of fire

God does not want you to perish
Let the Lord bless you
He will answer your prayer
He will

Lake of fire
