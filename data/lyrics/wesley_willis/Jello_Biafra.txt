You are a (???) maniac

You are a good person

You are a rock-and-roller
You used to be the lead singer of The Dead Kennedys
You sing for the band Lard
Keep on whooping it up

You are so friendly in the mix
You are my great man on the run
You are a good person from the South
I like you a lot, my man, and I will award you
