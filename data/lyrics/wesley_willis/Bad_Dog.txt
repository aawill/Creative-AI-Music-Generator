This dog is a wild mutt
He is a very wild doggy
He will attack you and give you rabies
He will bite the shit out of you

Don't even think about a leash

This dog pissed on my carpet
He shitted my house up
He tears stuff up
He'd tear up the devil it was there

Don't even think about a leash

This dog will jump all over you
He is a cruel mutt
He will bark at you
He will run you down to the ground
