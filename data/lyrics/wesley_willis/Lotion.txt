This band played at The Empty Bottle
About 280 people were at the show
The rock show was whooping it up
The rock show was burning a monkey's ass up

The band played it on
The band got down like a Magikist
The crowd roared like a lion
The rock show was whooping a horse's ass

The show was over at last
A lot of people met the rock band
The lead singer of Lotion wasn't nice at all
He was a stupid jerk
But otherwise, the show was terrific

Rock over London, rock on Chicago
