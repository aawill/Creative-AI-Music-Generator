My mind plays tricks on me every time I say something
It brings voices out of my head and talks to me vulgar
Then suddenly I start raving 

Chronic schizophrenia
Chronic schizophrenia
Chronic schizophrenia
Chronic schizophrenia 

But when I have bad luck I always hear evil voices talking to me vulgar
Everywhere I go riding the CTA bus all I hear is vulgarity
I hear no music at all 

Chronic schizophrenia
Chronic schizophrenia
Chronic schizophrenia
Chronic schizophrenia 

Riding the streets with no music sucks
Everywhere I go I cruise the streets being called an asshole
Plus I'm being ridiculed and called a bum and called stupid 

Chronic schizophrenia
Chronic schizophrenia
Chronic schizophrenia
Chronic schizophrenia 

Rock over London, rock on Chicago
Pontiac - we build excitement''''''''''''''''''
