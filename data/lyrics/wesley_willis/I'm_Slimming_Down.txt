In 1990, I used to weigh 397 pounds
I didn't feel good about being fat
I was too fat for my height
Suddenly, I started cutting down on fatty foods

I'm slimming down
I'm slimming down
I'm slimming down
I'm slimming down

I used to eat McDonalds hamburgers
I used to eat three Big Macs a night
In 1992, I gained 23 more pounds
Suddenly, I weighed 360 pounds heavier

I'm slimming down
I'm slimming down
I'm slimming down
I'm slimming down

From now on, I'm staying away from fatty foods
I'm only eating healthy foods
I'm going to watch my weight
I will make sure not to eat too much

I'm slimming down
I'm slimming down
I'm slimming down
I'm slimming down

Allstate, you're in good hands''''''''''''''''''''''''
