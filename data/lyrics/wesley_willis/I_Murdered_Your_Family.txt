Once upon a time, I went on a murder spree
I was on a shooting rampage
I came to your house with my Smith & Wesson
I was a stupid-ass drunk when I was trigger-happy

I murdered your family
I murdered your family
I murdered your family
I murdered your family

At 12:00 midnight, I invaded your home
I capped your brother and sister
I then stalked your mom and dad with the same handgun
Suddenly, I capped both of them in the head

I murdered your family
I murdered your family
I murdered your family
I murdered your family

When the police pulled up, I was done for
They arrested me on four murder charges
They carted me off to jail
They locked me up for killing four innocent people

I murdered your family
I murdered your family
I murdered your family
I murdered your family

Ocean Spray, crave the wave''''''''''''''''
