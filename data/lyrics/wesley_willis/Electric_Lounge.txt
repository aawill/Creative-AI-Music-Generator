I love this venue a lot
I love it here when I'm playing a rock show with my band
I haven't seen Austin, Texas before
This is my first time in this city

Fu Manchu played at this venue
About 250 people were at the show
The jam session was awesome when it whipped a horse's ass
The rock show was a joyride
