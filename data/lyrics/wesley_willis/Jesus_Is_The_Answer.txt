This is the song that I am going to be singing to you which is called "Jesus Is The Answer".
Number one: I'm gonna do this song again.
Number two: I'm gonna do this song again all the way up your ass.
And number three: I'm gonna fuck your ass up like you're in a car crash.
And number four: I'm gonna fuck you up like a goddamn accident.
And number five: Jesus is the answer.

This is the song that I'm going to rap out which is called "Jesus Is The Answer".
Jesus is the answer to all your problems.
He is your savior.
He died and he will come to heaven.

I'm gonna rap like this right now
And Jesus is the answer.

I'll tell you about the time when Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.
I was very grateful to hear about that stuff.
Take it to me.
It will make the best land to be the hand.
Tell it all to God, tell it all to God with your might.
I'm saying this again to let you know.

Jesus is the answer
Jesus is the answer
Jesus is the answer
Jesus is the answer
Tell it like it is, Jack.

It was so real to be real.
I told it the same way.
I have to tell it the same way so it is to be told.
Make it great for the change.
It should be the change.
I'm saying this again to let you know.

Jesus is the answer
Jesus is the answer
Jesus is the answer
Jesus is the answer
Tell it like it is, Jack.
Everywhere you go,
God is watching you.
Bust that sound check.

It will sound the trumpet for you like it will sound the trumpet for me.
Make this well for me and I will make it well for the mell.
I'm saying this again to let you know.

Jesus is the answer
Jesus is the answer
Jesus is the answer
Jesus is the answer

I'm letting you know that Jesus is the answer.
Amen.

Jesus is the answer
