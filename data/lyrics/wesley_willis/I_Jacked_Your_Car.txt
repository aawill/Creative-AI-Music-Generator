Once up upon a time, I went on a car jacking rampage.
I rode a stolen Honda scooter.
I had a pistol in my pocket.
I was busy helling around town.

I jacked your car
I jacked your car
I jacked your car
I jacked your car

As I rode the stolen Honda scooter, I was busy waving my pistol. 
Suddenly, I saw you stop your Studebaker at a red light.
I pulled up behind your slick ass.
I then jacked your Studebaker at gunpoint.
I forced you out of your car and commandeered it. 

I jacked your car
I jacked your car
I jacked your car
I jacked your car

At five o'clock PM, the police came to my house to eject me from my residence. 
The arrest warrant on my ass was for car jacking and auto theft. 
The police recovered the stolen Studebaker parked in my driveway. 
They handcuffed me and put me in the squad car. 

I jacked your car
I jacked your car
I jacked your car
I jacked your car
