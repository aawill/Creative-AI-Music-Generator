It's the end of the Old West.
It's the end of the old Gunsmoke.
It's the end of the old Western world.
It's the end of the gang gun fire.

It's the end of the Western
It's the end of the Western
It's the end of the Western
It's the end of the Western

It's the end of the good ol' days.
It's the end of the olden days.
It's the end of the Civil War.
It's the end of the battle days.

It's the end of the Western
It's the end of the Western
It's the end of the Western
It's the end of the Western

It's the end of World War I!
It's the end of World War II!
It's the end of the horse carriage!
IT's the end of the chuck wagon!

It's the end of the Western
It's the end of the Western
It's the end of the Western
It's the end of the Western

Rock over London
Rock on, Chicago.
