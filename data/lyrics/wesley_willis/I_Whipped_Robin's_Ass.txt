Robin got on my nerves
He was running me amok
He tried to steal my $100
I took a beating stick to Robin and whacked his tail

I whooped Robin's ass
I whooped Robin's ass
I whooped Robin's ass
I whooped Robin's ass

Robin tried to defeat me in my house
He wanted to punch me in the mouth
He was a stupid ass jerk
I knocked Robin to the floor with my fists

I whooped Robin's ass
I whooped Robin's ass
I whooped Robin's ass
I whooped Robin's ass

Robin got mad at me and knocked me to the floor
I got back up and knocked Robin to the floor
I told Robin to get his punk ass up
I told Robin to get his punk ass out of my house before I kill him

I whooped Robin's ass
I whooped Robin's ass
I whooped Robin's ass
I whooped Robin's ass
