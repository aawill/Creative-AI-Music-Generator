This band played at the Metro
About 700 people were at the show
The jam session was awesome
It whooped a horse's ass

The band played it on
The band got down like a Magikist
The crowd roared like a lion in a cage
The powerful jam session whooped a cheetah's ass

The rock show was over
A lot of people met the band
The jam session was a horse-whipper
It was a whooping on a mule's ass with a belt
