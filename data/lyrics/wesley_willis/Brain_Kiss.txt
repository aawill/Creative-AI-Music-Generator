This band played at the Empty Bottle
About 250 people were at the rock show
The jam session was perfect
The rock and roll burned a monkey up

The band played it on
The band got down like a Magikist
The crowd roared like a lion
The jam session whooped a llama's ass

The show was over
A lot of people met the band
The rock and roll show was awesome
It whipped a pony's ass with a belt
