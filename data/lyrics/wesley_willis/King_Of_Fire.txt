Once upon a time, a dragon flew over VanderCook
The beast had wings
He flew like an eagle
He can fly

King of fire
King of fire
King of fire
King of fire
King of fire
King of fire

The dragon spit fire at me
He did it just to scare me away from him
He was so angry, he was so mad

King of fire
King of fire
King of fire
King of fire
King of fire
King of fire

Scott Ho fired a gun at the target
He shot at me as I ran for my life
Instead of opening fire to BB me to my death,
He was chasing after me in his car
He didn't catch me

King of fire
King of fire
King of fire
King of fire
King of fire
King of fire
King of fire
King of fire
King of fire
