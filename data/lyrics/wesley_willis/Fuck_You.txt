Let me find another job
This doesn't pay me enough money at all
I want a better one
I'm going to tell you this

Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you

Take this job and shove it
I'm not working for you anymore
Stick it up your ass
Suck my damn dick, asshole
Fuck your crummy ass, jerk

Get your paws off me
Get the fuck away from me
Take your bullshit somewhere else
Jump into your hot rod and hit the road, asshole

Rock over London
Rock on Chicago
Diet Pepsi -- Uh huh''''''''''''''''''
