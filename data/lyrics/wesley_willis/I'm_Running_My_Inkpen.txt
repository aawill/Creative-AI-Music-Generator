I draw so good
I draw so well
I draw so great
Right on

I'm running my inkpen
I'm running my mouth
I'm running my inkpen
I'm running my mouth

Every year, I draw two thousand posters
I do make me a lot of money
I draw all the time
I can really work my ass off

I'm running my inkpen
I'm running my mouth
I'm running my inkpen
I'm running my mouth

A lot of people like my work
They said my artwork is great
It is so fabulous
It is so grateful

I'm running my inkpen
I'm running my mouth
I'm running my inkpen
I'm running my mouth
I'm running my inkpen
I'm running my mouth
I'm running my inkpen
I'm running my mouth

Cadillac, Cadillac, Cadillac style'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
