About 400 people were at the rock show
The jam session was awesome
It whooped a zebra's ass

The band played it on
The band got down like a Magikist
The crowd roared like a lion
The jam session whooped a deer's ass

A lot of people met the band
The rock show was awesome
It was a whooping on a mule's ass
