I'm going to shoot you in the head
I'm going to kill you
I'm going to shoot your ass in the head
I'm going to kill you
I'm going to pump you full of lead
I'm going to kill you
I'm going to riddle you with bullets
So look out

I'm going to pump you full of lead
So kiss this earth goodbye
I'm going to murder you, jerk
