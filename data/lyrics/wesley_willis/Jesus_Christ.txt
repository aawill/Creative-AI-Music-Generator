I am learning to live each day
It's just one at a time
I'm trusting in the lord to make it ever sublime
I will not put God first in all that I do
By accepting his son, Jesus, to carry me through

This he has promised, this he will do
And for Jesus alone can make all things new
I now trust in Jesus to show me the way
To happiness and love throughout the day
With him at my side and his love at my heart,
My life is beginning to have a new start

I am now learning how to love and forgive
My fellow man as I am learning to live
Learning to live means to accept the Lord
By following his powerful dictates and full accord
This I can do with Jesus at my side
We now have a love that will never subside
