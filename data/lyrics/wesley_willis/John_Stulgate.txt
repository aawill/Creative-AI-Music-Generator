You are my friend
You are my main man
You are the biggest friend in me
You are the nicest friend in me

You like buying drawings of Chicago from me
So far, you have 250 of them
I do good work
I do it well with my bare hands

These drawings will be worth $1000 some day
Some day, I'm going to be a rich man
All I have to do is keep the good work up
Right on, brother
