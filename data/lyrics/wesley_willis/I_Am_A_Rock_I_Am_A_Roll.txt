God is running the show
He is on the run
He is making sure that the impact is grateful
Let the good times roll you

I am a rock, I am a roll
I am a rock, I am a roll

I rock on the streets every day
Come join the rat race
I'm going to run your ass down

I am a rock, I am a roll
I am a rock, I am a roll

The KKK robbed Citgo's service station
They also broke into the storage room
They got away with 5000 dollars in cash

I am a rock, I am a roll
I am a rock, I am a roll

Rock over London
Rock on, Chicago
Pepsi - gotta have it''''''''''''''''''
