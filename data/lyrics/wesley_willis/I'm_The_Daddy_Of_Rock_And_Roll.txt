I'm the godfather of being a rock musician
I'm the godfather of singing
I'm the godfather of taking everyone on a music joyride
I love the rocket travel

I'm the daddy of rock and roll
I'm the daddy of rock and roll
I'm the daddy of rock and roll
I'm the daddy of rock and roll

I love singing in my one-man band
I love playing the joyride music that you came for
I also play my Technics KN3000
They are the brothers of my rock music

I'm the daddy of rock and roll
I'm the daddy of rock and roll
I'm the daddy of rock and roll
I'm the daddy of rock and roll

This is my rock and roll music career God gave me
God gave me this rock music career to keep my busy
Back in 1991, I used to hit old people with folding chairs
Suddenly, I moved to the north side of Chicago, Illinois in the summer of 1992
It made a rock star out of me at last

I'm the daddy of rock and roll
I'm the daddy of rock and roll
I'm the daddy of rock and roll
I'm the daddy of rock and roll

Allstate, you're in good hands''''''''''''''''''''''''
