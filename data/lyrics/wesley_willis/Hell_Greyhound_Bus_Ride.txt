It's Wednesday, April 2, 1997, at 12:00 PM
I took a Greyhound bus to Des Moines, Iowa
It was a six-hour profanity demon hell ride

At 6:00 PM, the Greyhound bus
Arrived at the Des Moines bus station
Two of my music fans picked me up
And drove me to Fort Dodge, Iowa

Hell greyhound bus ride
Hell greyhound bus ride
Hell greyhound bus ride
Hell greyhound bus ride

At 2:00 PM on Friday, April 4, 1997
I went on a radio show joyride
I whipped out my Technics KN3000 keyboard
And sung four rock songs on 88.1 KICB

At 6:30 PM, I rode with my friends
To Knights of Columbus for sound checking
At 9:30 PM, I got up on stage and sung
Twenty rock songs in front of 200 rock fans

Hell greyhound bus ride
Hell greyhound bus ride
Hell greyhound bus ride
Hell greyhound bus ride

At 11:20 AM on Saturday, April 5, 1997
I caught the Greyhound bus to Chicago, Illinois
The Greyhound bus left Des Moines, Iowa at 11:30 AM
It was an eight-hour profanity demon hell ride without music

At 7:30 PM, the Greyhound bus
Arrived at the Chicago bus station
I then got off the intercity bus
And yelled like a stupid fool

Hell greyhound bus ride
Hell greyhound bus ride
Hell greyhound bus ride
Hell greyhound bus ride

Kinkos, it's the new way to office''''''''''''''''
