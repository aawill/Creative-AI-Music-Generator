This band played at the Fireside Bowl
About 250 people were at the rock and roll show
The rock and roll was awesome
It whooped a jackass' ass

Foo can rock, Foo can roll
Foo can rock, Foo can roll

The band played it on
The band got down like a Magikist
The crowd roared like a lion
The rock show whopped a donkey's ass

Foo can rock, Foo can roll
Foo can rock, Foo can roll

The show was over
A lot of people met the band
The rock show was awesome
The jam session whooped a mule's ass

Foo can rock, Foo can roll
Foo can rock, Foo can roll

Rock over London
Rock on, Chicago
Pontiac - we are driving excitement''''''''''''''''
