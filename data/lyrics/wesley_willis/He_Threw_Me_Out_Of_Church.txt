Once upon a time,
I cursed in Daniel's Chapel A.M.E. Zion Church
I told one of the deacons to lick a cheetah's dick
Reverend Henry Miller preached about my foul language
He told the congregation that I have a filthy mouth

He Threw Me Out Of Church
He Threw Me Out Of Church
He Threw Me Out Of Church
He Threw Me Out Of Church

For the first time I told Reverend Henry Miller to kiss my black ass
I also told him to suck a donkey's dick
He got so tired of my horsecrap
He ordered one of the deacons to throw me out
He escorted me to the door

He Threw Me Out Of Church
He Threw Me Out Of Church
He Threw Me Out Of Church
He Threw Me Out Of Church

When I went to church that same Sunday, I brought a baseball bat
I went up to the pulpit and clubbed Reverend Henry Miller in the head
He dropped to the floor
Suddenly, the police was called on me
I ran out of church grinning when the SWAT car pulled up

He Threw Me Out Of Church
He Threw Me Out Of Church
He Threw Me Out Of Church
He Threw Me Out Of Church
