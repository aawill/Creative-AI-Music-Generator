You are my friend to the max
You are on my side at last
You are my buddy in the mix
I like you a lot in the long run

You are my working class dog
You are a tall male like a light pole
You work hard at Bicycle Music Company
You work real hard for peanuts

You are my buddy to the end
You are on my side in the long run
You are so busy publishing my music
That's the way at keeping my songs safe at last
