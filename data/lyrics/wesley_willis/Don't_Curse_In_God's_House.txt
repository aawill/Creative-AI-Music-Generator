Once upon a time, I was cursing in Morning Star Baptist Church
I called the evangelist a stupid crucifuck
Reverend Richard Price preached about my vulgar language
He told the congregation in the sanctuary that I got a nasty filthy mouth

Don't curse in God's house
Don't curse in God's house
Don't curse in God's house
Don't curse in God's house

At this time, I told the preacher to fuck off
I told Reverend Richard Price to suck a male camel's dick
Suddenly, he ordered one of the deacons to throw me out of church
He then escorted me to the door

Don't curse in God's house
Don't curse in God's house
Don't curse in God's house
Don't curse in God's house

When I went to church that same Sunday, I picked up a beating stick
I went up to the pulpit and clocked Reverend Richard Price in the head
He fell to the floor
Suddenly, the police was chasing me out of church after I called the preacher an asshole

Don't curse in God's house
Don't curse in God's house
Don't curse in God's house
Don't curse in God's house

Hardees, we're out to win you over''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
