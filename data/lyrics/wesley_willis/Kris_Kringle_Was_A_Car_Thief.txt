Once upon a time Kris Kringle stole a beat up Maverick parked behind my house
He used a screwdriver to jimmy the lock
After that he jumped into the stolen car and started up the motor
He drove away the stolen car in hot pursuit

Kris Kringle was a car thief 

Kris Kringle sped down West Fulerton Avenue looking for hookers
He was firewalling the throttle
When the Chicago police officers spotted the stolen Maverick as it soon passed them they turned on their sirens
Then they went after the beat up stolen Maverick
