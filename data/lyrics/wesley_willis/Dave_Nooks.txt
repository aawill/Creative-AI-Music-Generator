You are my friend to the max
You are my friend in the mix
You are on my side as I speak
I like you a lot like Cool Whip

You are my heavy rock partner
You are my bass guitarist
You play bass guitar in my Fiasco band
You can really get me on the rock and roll super highway

You are my buddy to the turn of the century
You are my friend to eternity until I pass away
You are my best friend as the world turns
