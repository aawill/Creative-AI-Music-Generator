Look out, you stupid bitch
I'm going to burglarize your home
I'm coming in here with my .20 caliber pistol
I'm going to rob you and kill your ass

Call the police on me
Call the police on me
Call the police on me
Call the police on me

You are going to be terrorized
You are going to be shot to death
You are not going to see tomorrow
I'm going to kill you and steal your hot rod

Call the police on me. 
Call the police on me. 
Call the police on me. 
Call the police on me. 

You life is going to expire as of now 
Start picking out your coffin 
I'm coming after you with an assault rifle 
I'm going to look you in your eye and pump you full of led 

Call the police on me. 
Call the police on me. 
Call the police on me. 
Call the police on me.
