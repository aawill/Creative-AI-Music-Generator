Scream Dracula Scream!

You are an educated rapper
You can really rap your ass off
You can really knock it out
You are the greatest one of all

Eazy-E (Tried to kill me)
Eazy-E (Tried to kill me)
Eazy-E (Tried to kill me)
Eazy-E (But you couldn't do it, G)

Keep on playing that rap music
Keep on grooving on the jap move
Jam harder like a Magikist
Rock harder like a Magikist

Eazy-E (Tried to kill me)
Eazy-E (Tried to kill me)
Eazy-E (Was fuckin' with me)
Eazy-E (But you couldn't kill me)

God damn that Eazy-E,
That motherfucker tried to kill me.
So what if I called you back from the dead? I sure as fuck didn't call you to try and choke me to death. I was all out of breath, I had no energy left. Luckily that redneck came out with a shotgun and backhanded your ass. You think that you can jump into someone's body and try to kill me? You think that just 'cause you're from Compton you can kill me? Just because you're dead you can kill me? Well fuck you Eazy-E! Cause there's something you don't know about me, and that's that I represent my city, yeah yeah. I'm a real Columbus G, so if you want it bitch, then come get some. I'll be sitting at the waffle house on 161. That's the waffle house just off 571. With a plate full of eggs, and a girl between my legs, with a score to settle with your ass.

Eazy-E
Eazy-E
Please stop trying
To fuck with me.

Bitch.

Rock, rap and roll will never die
The music will pick you up
The jam session will rock your artwork
Rock, rap and roll will entertain your artistic talent

(Pimp Daddy Welfare)
Fuck you Eazy-E!

(Pimp Daddy Welfare)
Fuck... Eazy-E... comin' back from the dead. Stay dead, bitch.''''''''''''''''
