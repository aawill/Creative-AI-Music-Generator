This band played at the Double Door
About 500 people were at the show
The rock and roll was perfect
It whooped a pony's ass

The band played it on
The band got down like a Magikist
The crowd roared like a lion
The rock show whooped a horse's ass

The show was over at last
A lot of people met the rock band
The rock and roll was perfect
The rock show whooped a mule's ass
