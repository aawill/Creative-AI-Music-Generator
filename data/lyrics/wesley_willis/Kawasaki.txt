"Shoot the gun, watch your wife, motherfucker"

I was riding my motorcycle on the highway
I was speeding down the lane
I was riding on the roadway
I was firewalling the throttle

Kawasaki lets the good times roll

I rode my motorbike to the miracle mile
I was speeding at 50 miles per hour
I was riding on the highway
I was streetwise because of it

Kawasaki lets the good times roll

When I hit Green Bay, Wisconsin, I was on the road to utopia
I was riding at the speed of thought
I was on the move and in the groove
I cruised the miracle mile by moving by wheels

Rock over London
Rock on, Chicago
Pontiac - we build excitement
